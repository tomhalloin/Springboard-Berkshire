If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500 \nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index \nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. </p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> \nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \n</p>\n<p> \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \n \n</p>\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2006 was $16.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 18.4%.  Over the last 42 years (that is, since present management \ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $70,281, a rate of 21.4% compounded annually.* \n \n</p>\n<p>We believe that $16.9 billion is a record for a one-year gain in net worth \xe2\x80\x93 more than has ever \nbeen booked by any American business, leaving aside boosts that have occurred because of mergers (e.g., \nAOL\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of Time Warner).  Of course, Exxon Mobil and other companies earn far more than \nBerkshire, but their earnings largely go to dividends and/or repurchases, rather than to building net worth. \n</p>\n<p> \nAll that said, a confession about our 2006 gain is in order.  Our most important business, \n</p>\n<p>insurance, benefited from a large dose of luck:  Mother Nature, bless her heart, went on vacation.  After \nhammering us with hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 \xe2\x80\x93 storms that caused us to lose a bundle on super-cat \ninsurance \xe2\x80\x93 she just vanished.  Last year, the red ink from this activity turned black \xe2\x80\x93 very black. \n</p>\n<p> \nIn addition, the great majority of our 73 businesses did outstandingly well in 2006.  Let me focus \n</p>\n<p>for a moment on one of our largest operations, GEICO.  What management accomplished there was simply \nextraordinary. \n</p>\n<p> \nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you before, Tony Nicely, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, went to work at the company 45 years ago, \n</p>\n<p>two months after turning 18.  He became CEO in 1992, and from then on the company\xe2\x80\x99s growth exploded.  \nIn addition, Tony has delivered staggering productivity gains in recent years.  Between yearend 2003 and \nyearend 2006, the number of GEICO policies increased from 5.7 million to 8.1 million, a jump of 42%.  \nYet during that same period, the company\xe2\x80\x99s employees (measured on a fulltime-equivalent basis) fell 3.5%.  \nSo productivity grew 47%.  And GEICO didn\xe2\x80\x99t start fat. \n</p>\n<p> \nThat remarkable gain has allowed GEICO to maintain its all-important position as a low-cost \n</p>\n<p>producer, even though it has dramatically increased advertising expenditures.  Last year GEICO spent $631 \nmillion on ads, up from $238 million in 2003 (and up from $31 million in 1995, when Berkshire took \ncontrol).  Today, GEICO spends far more on ads than any of its competitors, even those much larger.  We \nwill continue to raise the bar. \n</p>\n<p> \nLast year I told you that if you had a new son or grandson to be sure to name him Tony.  But Don \n</p>\n<p>Keough, a Berkshire director, recently had a better idea.  After reviewing GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s performance in 2006, \nhe wrote me, \xe2\x80\x9cForget births.  Tell the shareholders to immediately change the names of their present \nchildren to Tony or Antoinette.\xe2\x80\x9d  Don signed his letter \xe2\x80\x9cTony.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \nCharlie Munger \xe2\x80\x93 my partner and Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s vice chairman \xe2\x80\x93 and I run what has turned out to be \n</p>\n<p>a big business, one with 217,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $100 billion.  We certainly \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t plan it that way.  Charlie began as a lawyer, and I thought of myself as a security analyst.  Sitting in \nthose seats, we both grew skeptical about the ability of big entities of any type to function well.  Size seems \nto make many organizations slow-thinking, resistant to change and smug.  In Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9cWe shape \nour buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here\xe2\x80\x99s a telling fact: Of the ten non-oil companies \nhaving the largest market capitalization in 1965 \xe2\x80\x93 titans such as General Motors, Sears, DuPont and \nEastman Kodak \xe2\x80\x93 only one made the 2006 list.   \n</p>\n<p> \n  \n *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares.  Figures for the B shares \nare 1/30th of those shown for the A. \n</p>\n<p> 3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>In fairness, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen plenty of successes as well, some truly outstanding.  There are many giant-\ncompany managers whom I greatly admire; Ken Chenault of American Express, Jeff Immelt of G.E. and \nDick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo come quickly to mind.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could do the management job \nthey do.  And I know I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy many of the duties that come with their positions \xe2\x80\x93 meetings, \nspeeches, foreign travel, the charity circuit and governmental relations.  For me, Ronald Reagan had it \nright: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably true that hard work never killed anyone \xe2\x80\x93 but why take the chance?\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p> \nSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the easy route, just sitting back and working through great managers who run their \n</p>\n<p>own shows.  My only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt and harden our corporate culture, and make major \ncapital-allocation decisions.  Our managers have returned this trust by working hard and effectively. \n</p>\n<p> \nFor their performance over the last 42 years \xe2\x80\x93 and particularly for 2006 \xe2\x80\x93 Charlie and I thank \n</p>\n<p>them. \n \n</p>\n<p>Yardsticks \n \n Charlie and I measure Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s progress and evaluate its intrinsic value in a number of ways. \nNo single criterion is effective in doing these jobs, and even an avalanche of statistics will not capture some \nfactors that are important.  For example, it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that we have managers much younger than I available \nto succeed me.  Berkshire has never been in better shape in this regard \xe2\x80\x93 but I can\xe2\x80\x99t prove it to you with \nnumbers. \n \n There are two statistics, however, that are of real importance.  The first is the amount of \ninvestments (including cash and cash-equivalents) that we own on a per-share basis.  Arriving at this figure, \nwe exclude investments held in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings.  \nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the record since present management acquired control of Berkshire: \n \n</p>\n<p> \nYear\n</p>\n<p> \nPer-Share Investments* \n</p>\n<p>  \n1965 ..................................................................... $         4 \n1975 ..................................................................... 159 \n1985 ..................................................................... 2,407 \n1995 ..................................................................... 21,817 \n2006 ..................................................................... $80,636\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006....................        27.5% \nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006....................        12.6% \n</p>\n<p>  *Net of minority interests \n \n In our early years we put most of our retained earnings and insurance float into investments in \nmarketable securities.  Because of this emphasis, and because the securities we purchased generally did \nwell, our growth rate in investments was for a long time quite high. \n \n Over the years, however, we have focused more and more on the acquisition of operating \nbusinesses.  Using our funds for these purchases has both slowed our growth in investments and accelerated \nour gains in pre-tax earnings from non-insurance businesses, the second yardstick we use.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s how \nthose earnings have looked: \n</p>\n<p> 4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> \nYear Pre-Tax Earnings Per Share* \n  \n1965 ..................................................................... $        4 \n1975 ..................................................................... 4 \n1985 ..................................................................... 52 \n1995 ..................................................................... 175 \n2006 ..................................................................... $3,625\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006 ....................        17.9% \nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006 ....................        31.7% \n</p>\n<p> *Excluding purchase-accounting adjustments and net of minority interests \n \n Last year we had a good increase in non-insurance earnings \xe2\x80\x93 38%.  Large gains from here on in, \nthough, will come only if we are able to make major, and sensible, acquisitions.  That will not be easy.  We \ndo, however, have one advantage: More and more, Berkshire has become \xe2\x80\x9cthe buyer of choice\xe2\x80\x9d for \nbusiness owners and managers.  Initially, we were viewed that way only in the U.S. (and more often than \nnot by private companies).  We\xe2\x80\x99ve long wanted, nonetheless, to extend Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s appeal beyond U.S. \nborders.  And last year, our globe-trotting finally got underway. \n \nAcquisitions \n \n We began 2006 by completing the three acquisitions pending at yearend 2005, spending about $6 \nbillion for PacifiCorp, Business Wire and Applied Underwriters.  All are performing very well. \n \n The highlight of the year, however, was our July 5th acquisition of most of ISCAR, an Israeli \ncompany, and our new association with its chairman, Eitan Wertheimer, and CEO, Jacob Harpaz.  The \nstory here began on October 25, 2005, when I received a 1\xc2\xbc-page letter from Eitan, of whom I then knew \nnothing.  The letter began, \xe2\x80\x9cI am writing to introduce you to ISCAR,\xe2\x80\x9d and proceeded to describe a cutting-\ntool business carried on in 61 countries.  Then Eitan wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have for some time considered the issues \nof generational transfer and ownership that are typical for large family enterprises, and have given much \nthought to ISCAR\xe2\x80\x99s future.  Our conclusion is that Berkshire Hathaway would be the ideal home for \nISCAR.  We believe that ISCAR would continue to thrive as a part of your portfolio of businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n</p>\n<p>Overall, Eitan\xe2\x80\x99s letter made the quality of the company and the character of its management leap \noff the page.  It also made me want to learn more, and in November, Eitan, Jacob and ISCAR\xe2\x80\x99s CFO, \nDanny Goldman, came to Omaha.  A few hours with them convinced me that if we were to make a deal, we \nwould be teaming up with extraordinarily talented managers who could be trusted to run the business after \na sale with all of the energy and dedication that they had exhibited previously.  However, having never \nbought a business based outside of the U.S. (though I had bought a number of foreign stocks), I needed to \nget educated on some tax and jurisdictional matters.  With that task completed, Berkshire purchased 80% of \nISCAR for $4 billion.  The remaining 20% stays in the hands of the Wertheimer family, making it our \nvalued partner. \n \n ISCAR\xe2\x80\x99s products are small, consumable cutting tools that are used in conjunction with large and \nexpensive machine tools.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a business without magic except for that imparted by the people who run it.  \nBut Eitan, Jacob and their associates are true managerial magicians who constantly develop tools that make \ntheir customers\xe2\x80\x99 machines more productive.  The result: ISCAR makes money because it enables its \ncustomers to make more money.  There is no better recipe for continued success. \n</p>\n<p> 5</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> In September, Charlie and I, along with five Berkshire associates, visited ISCAR in Israel.  We \xe2\x80\x93 \nand I mean every one of us \xe2\x80\x93 have never been more impressed with any operation.  At ISCAR, as \nthroughout Israel, brains and energy are ubiquitous.  Berkshire shareholders are lucky to have joined with \nEitan, Jacob, Danny and their talented associates. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n A few months later, Berkshire again became \xe2\x80\x9cthe buyer of choice\xe2\x80\x9d in a deal brought to us by my \nfriend, John Roach, of Fort Worth.  John, many of you will remember, was Chairman of Justin Industries, \nwhich we bought in 2000.  At that time John was helping John Justin, who was terminally ill, find a \npermanent home for his company.  John Justin died soon after we bought Justin Industries, but it has since \nbeen run exactly as we promised him it would be. \n \n Visiting me in November, John Roach brought along Paul Andrews, Jr., owner of about 80% of \nTTI, a Fort Worth distributor of electronic components.  Over a 35-year period, Paul built TTI from \n$112,000 of sales to $1.3 billion.  He is a remarkable entrepreneur and operator. \n \n Paul, 64, loves running his business.  But not long ago he happened to witness how disruptive the \ndeath of a founder can be both to a private company\xe2\x80\x99s employees and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s family.  What starts out \nas disruptive, furthermore, often evolves into destructive.  About a year ago, therefore, Paul began to think \nabout selling TTI.  His goal was to put his business in the hands of an owner he had carefully chosen, rather \nthan allowing a trust officer or lawyer to conduct an auction after his death. \n \n Paul rejected the idea of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic\xe2\x80\x9d buyer, knowing that in the pursuit of \xe2\x80\x9csynergies,\xe2\x80\x9d an owner \nof that type would be apt to dismantle what he had so carefully built, a move that would uproot hundreds of \nhis associates (and perhaps wound TTI\xe2\x80\x99s business in the process).  He also ruled out a private equity firm, \nwhich would very likely load the company with debt and then flip it as soon as possible. \n \n That left Berkshire.  Paul and I met on the morning of November 15th and made a deal before \nlunch.  Later he wrote me: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter our meeting, I am confident that Berkshire is the right owner for TTI . . . \nI am proud of our past and excited about our future.\xe2\x80\x9d  And so are Charlie and I. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We also made some \xe2\x80\x9ctuck-in\xe2\x80\x9d acquisitions during 2006 at Fruit of the Loom (\xe2\x80\x9cFruit\xe2\x80\x9d), MiTek, \nCTB, Shaw and Clayton.  Fruit made the largest purchases.  First, it bought Russell Corp., a leading \nproducer of athletic apparel and uniforms for about $1.2 billion (including assumed debt) and in December \nit agreed to buy the intimate apparel business of VF Corp.  Together, these acquisitions add about $2.2 \nbillion to Fruit\xe2\x80\x99s sales and bring with them about 23,000 employees. \n \n Charlie and I love it when we can acquire businesses that can be placed under managers, such as \nJohn Holland at Fruit, who have already shown their stuff at Berkshire.  MiTek, for example, has made 14 \nacquisitions since we purchased it in 2001, and Gene Toombs has delivered results from these deals far in \nexcess of what he had predicted.  In effect, we leverage the managerial talent already with us by these tuck-\nin deals.  We will make many more. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We continue, however, to need \xe2\x80\x9celephants\xe2\x80\x9d in order for us to use Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s flood of incoming \ncash.  Charlie and I must therefore ignore the pursuit of mice and focus our acquisition efforts on much \nbigger game. \n \n</p>\n<p>Our exemplar is the older man who crashed his grocery cart into that of a much younger fellow \nwhile both were shopping.  The elderly man explained apologetically that he had lost track of his wife and \nwas preoccupied searching for her.  His new acquaintance said that by coincidence his wife had also \nwandered off and suggested that it might be more efficient if they jointly looked for the two women.  \nAgreeing, the older man asked his new companion what his wife looked like.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a gorgeous blonde,\xe2\x80\x9d \nthe fellow answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a body that would cause a bishop to go through a stained glass window, and \nshe\xe2\x80\x99s wearing tight white shorts.

If you have an acquisition candidate that fits, \ncall me \xe2\x80\x93 day or night.  And then watch me shatter a stained glass window. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the four major operating sectors of Berkshire.  Lumping their financial figures \ntogether impedes analysis.  So we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at them as four separate businesses, starting with the all\xe2\x80\x93\nimportant insurance group. \n \nInsurance \n \n Next month marks the 40th anniversary of our entrance into the insurance business.  It was on \nMarch 9, 1967, that Berkshire purchased National Indemnity and its companion company, National Fire &amp; \nMarine, from Jack Ringwalt for $8.6 million. \n \n Jack was a long-time friend of mine and an excellent, but somewhat eccentric, businessman.  For \nabout ten minutes every year he would get the urge to sell his company.  But those moods \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps \nbrought on by a tiff with regulators or an unfavorable jury verdict \xe2\x80\x93 quickly vanished. \n \n In the mid-1960s, I asked investment banker Charlie Heider, a mutual friend of mine and Jack\xe2\x80\x99s, \nto alert me the next time Jack was \xe2\x80\x9cin heat.\xe2\x80\x9d  When Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s call came, I sped to meet Jack.  We made a \ndeal in a few minutes, with me waiving an audit, \xe2\x80\x9cdue diligence\xe2\x80\x9d or anything else that would give Jack an \nopportunity to reconsider.  We just shook hands, and that was that. \n \n When we were due to close the purchase at Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s office, Jack was late.  Finally arriving, he \nexplained that he had been driving around looking for a parking meter with some unexpired time.  That was \na magic moment for me.  I knew then that Jack was going to be my kind of manager. \n \n When Berkshire purchased Jack\xe2\x80\x99s two insurers, they had \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d of $17 million.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve regularly \noffered a long explanation of float in earlier reports, which you can read on our website.  Simply put, float \nis money we hold that is not ours but which we get to invest. \n \n At the end of 2006, our float had grown to $50.9 billion, and we have since written a huge \nretroactive reinsurance contract with Equitas \xe2\x80\x93 which I will describe in the next section \xe2\x80\x93 that boosts float \nby another $7 billion.  Much of the gain we\xe2\x80\x99ve made has come through our acquisition of other insurers, \nbut we\xe2\x80\x99ve also had outstanding internal growth, particularly at Ajit Jain\xe2\x80\x99s amazing reinsurance operation.  \nNaturally, I had no notion in 1967 that our float would develop as it has.  There\xe2\x80\x99s much to be said for just \nputting one foot in front of the other every day. \n \n The float from retroactive reinsurance contracts, of which we have many, automatically drifts \ndown over time.  Therefore, it will be difficult for us to increase float in the future unless we make new \nacquisitions in the insurance field.  Whatever its size, however, the all-important cost of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s float \nover time is likely to be significantly below that of the industry, perhaps even falling to less than zero.  \nNote the words \xe2\x80\x9cover time.\xe2\x80\x9d  There will be bad years periodically.  You can be sure of that. \n \n In 2006, though, everything went right in insurance \xe2\x80\x93 really right.  Our managers \xe2\x80\x93 Tony Nicely \n(GEICO), Ajit Jain (B-H Reinsurance), Joe Brandon and Tad Montross (General Re), Don Wurster \n(National Indemnity Primary), Tom Nerney (U.S. Liability), Tim Kenesey (Medical Protective), Rod \nEldred (Homestate Companies and Cypress), Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies (Applied Underwriters), John \nKizer (Central States) and Don Towle (Kansas Bankers Surety) \xe2\x80\x93 simply shot the lights out.  When I recite \ntheir names, I feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99m at Cooperstown, reading from the Hall of Fame roster.  Of course, the overall \ninsurance industry also had a terrific year in 2006.  But our managers delivered results generally superior to \nthose of their competitors. \n</p>\n<p> 7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Below is the tally on our underwriting and float for each major sector of insurance.

The big unknown is super-cat insurance.  Were the terrible hurricane seasons \nof 2004-05 aberrations?  Or were they our planet\xe2\x80\x99s first warning that the climate of the 21st Century will \ndiffer materially from what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past?  If the answer to the second question is yes, 2006 will \nsoon be perceived as a misleading period of calm preceding a series of devastating storms.  These could \nrock the insurance industry.  It\xe2\x80\x99s na\xc3\xafve to think of Katrina as anything close to a worst-case event. \n \n Neither Ajit Jain, who manages our super-cat operation, nor I know what lies ahead.  We do know \nthat it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications \nfor insurers. \n \n Don\xe2\x80\x99t think, however, that we have lost our taste for risk.  We remain prepared to lose $6 billion \nin a single event, if we have been paid appropriately for assuming that risk.  We are not willing, though, to \ntake on even very small exposures at prices that don\xe2\x80\x99t reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities.  \nAppropriate prices don\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee profits in any given year, but inappropriate prices most certainly \nguarantee eventual losses.  Rates have recently fallen because a flood of capital has entered the super-cat \nfield.  We have therefore sharply reduced our wind exposures.  Our behavior here parallels that which we \nemploy in financial markets: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. \n \nLloyd\xe2\x80\x99s, Equitas and Retroactive Reinsurance \n \n Last year \xe2\x80\x93 we are getting now to Equitas \xe2\x80\x93 Berkshire agreed to enter into a huge retroactive \nreinsurance contract, a policy that protects an insurer against losses that have already happened, but whose \ncost is not yet known.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you details of the agreement shortly.  But let\xe2\x80\x99s first take a journey through \ninsurance history, following the route that led to our deal. \n \n Our tale begins around 1688, when Edward Lloyd opened a small coffee house in London.  \nThough no Starbucks, his shop was destined to achieve worldwide fame because of the commercial \nactivities of its clientele \xe2\x80\x93 shipowners, merchants and venturesome British capitalists.  As these parties \nsipped Edward\xe2\x80\x99s brew, they began to write contracts transferring the risk of a disaster at sea from the \nowners of ships and their cargo to the capitalists, who wagered that a given voyage would be completed \nwithout incident.  These capitalists eventually became known as \xe2\x80\x9cunderwriters at Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n Though many people believe Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s to be an insurance company, that is not the case.  It is \ninstead a place where many member-insurers transact business, just as they did centuries ago. \n \n Over time, the underwriters solicited passive investors to join in syndicates.  Additionally, the \nbusiness broadened beyond marine risks into every imaginable form of insurance, including exotic \ncoverages that spread the fame of Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s far and wide.  The underwriters left the coffee house, found \ngrander quarters and formalized some rules of association.  And those persons who passively backed the \nunderwriters became known as \xe2\x80\x9cnames.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p> 8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Eventually, the names came to include many thousands of people from around the world, who \njoined expecting to pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk.  True, prospective names were \nalways solemnly told that they would have unlimited and everlasting liability for the consequences of their \nsyndicate\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cdown to the last cufflink,\xe2\x80\x9d as the quaint description went.  But that warning \ncame to be viewed as perfunctory.  Three hundred years of retained cufflinks acted as a powerful sedative \nto the names poised to sign up. \n \n Then came asbestos.  When its prospective costs were added to the tidal wave of environmental \nand product claims that surfaced in the 1980s, Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s began to implode.  Policies written decades earlier \xe2\x80\x93 \nand largely forgotten about \xe2\x80\x93 were developing huge losses.  No one could intelligently estimate their total, \nbut it was certain to be many tens of billions of dollars.  The specter of unending and unlimited losses \nterrified existing names and scared away prospects.  Many names opted for bankruptcy; some even chose \nsuicide. \n \n From these shambles, there came a desperate effort to resuscitate Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s.  In 1996, the powers \nthat be at the institution allotted \xc2\xa311.1 billion to a new company, Equitas, and made it responsible for \npaying all claims on policies written before 1993.  In effect, this plan pooled the misery of the many \nsyndicates in trouble.  Of course, the money allotted could prove to be insufficient \xe2\x80\x93 and if that happened, \nthe names remained liable for the shortfall. \n \n</p>\n<p>But the new plan, by concentrating all of the liabilities in one place, had the advantage of \neliminating much of the costly intramural squabbling that went on among syndicates.  Moreover, the \npooling allowed claims evaluation, negotiation and litigation to be handled more intelligently than had been \nthe case previously.  Equitas embraced Ben Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cWe must all hang together, or assuredly \nwe shall hang separately.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n \n From the start, many people predicted Equitas would eventually fail.  But as Ajit and I reviewed \nthe facts in the spring of 2006 \xe2\x80\x93 13 years after the last exposed policy had been written and after the \npayment of \xc2\xa311.3 billion in claims \xe2\x80\x93 we concluded that the patient was likely to survive.  And so we \ndecided to offer a huge reinsurance policy to Equitas. \n \n Because plenty of imponderables continue to exist, Berkshire could not provide Equitas, and its \n27,972 names, unlimited protection.  But we said \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99m simplifying \xe2\x80\x93 that if Equitas would give us \n$7.12 billion in cash and securities (this is the float I spoke about), we would pay all of its future claims and \nexpenses up to $13.9 billion.  That amount was $5.7 billion above what Equitas had recently guessed its \nultimate liabilities to be.  Thus the names received a huge \xe2\x80\x93 and almost certainly sufficient \xe2\x80\x93 amount of \nfuture protection against unpleasant surprises.  Indeed the protection is so large that Equitas plans a cash \npayment to its thousands of names, an event few of them had ever dreamed possible. \n \n And how will Berkshire fare?  That depends on how much \xe2\x80\x9cknown\xe2\x80\x9d claims will end up costing us, \nhow many yet-to-be-presented claims will surface and what they will cost, how soon claim payments will \nbe made and how much we earn on the cash we receive before it must be paid out.  Ajit and I think the odds \nare in our favor.  And should we be wrong, Berkshire can handle it. \n \n Scott Moser, the CEO of Equitas, summarized the transaction neatly: \xe2\x80\x9cNames wanted to sleep \neasy at night, and we think we\xe2\x80\x99ve just bought them the world\xe2\x80\x99s best mattress.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * \nWarning: It\xe2\x80\x99s time to eat your broccoli \xe2\x80\x93 I am now going to talk about accounting matters.  I owe \n</p>\n<p>this to those Berkshire shareholders who love reading about debits and credits.  I hope both of you find this \ndiscussion helpful.  All others can skip this section; there will be no quiz. \n \n Berkshire has done many retroactive transactions \xe2\x80\x93 in both number and amount a multiple of such \npolicies entered into by any other insurer.  We are the reinsurer of choice for these coverages because the \nobligations that are transferred to us \xe2\x80\x93 for example, lifetime indemnity and medical payments to be made to \ninjured workers \xe2\x80\x93 may not be fully satisfied for 50 years or more.  No other company can offer the certainty  \n</p>\n<p> 9</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>that Berkshire can, in terms of guaranteeing the full and fair settlement of these obligations.  This fact is \nimportant to the original insurer, policyholders and regulators. \n \n The accounting procedure for retroactive transactions is neither well known nor intuitive.  The \nbest way for shareholders to understand it, therefore, is for us to simply lay out the debits and credits.  \nCharlie and I would like to see this done more often.  We sometimes encounter accounting footnotes about \nimportant transactions that leave us baffled, and we go away suspicious that the reporting company wished \nit that way.  (For example, try comprehending transactions \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed\xe2\x80\x9d in the old 10-Ks of Enron, even \nafter you know how the movie ended.) \n \n</p>\n<p>So let us summarize our accounting for the Equitas transaction.  The major debits will be to Cash \nand Investments, Reinsurance Recoverable, and Deferred Charges for Reinsurance Assumed (\xe2\x80\x9cDCRA\xe2\x80\x9d).  \nThe major credit will be to Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense.  No profit or loss will be \nrecorded at the inception of the transaction, but underwriting losses will thereafter be incurred annually as \nthe DCRA asset is amortized downward.  The amount of the annual amortization charge will be primarily \ndetermined by how our end-of-the-year estimates as to the timing and amount of future loss payments \ncompare to the estimates made at the beginning of the year.  Eventually, when the last claim has been paid, \nthe DCRA account will be reduced to zero.  That day is 50 years or more away. \n \n What\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember is that retroactive insurance contracts always produce underwriting \nlosses for us.  Whether these losses are worth experiencing depends on whether the cash we have received \nproduces investment income that exceeds the losses.  Recently our DCRA charges have annually delivered \n$300 million or so of underwriting losses, which have been more than offset by the income we have \nrealized through use of the cash we received as a premium.  Absent new retroactive contracts, the amount \nof the annual charge would normally decline over time.  After the Equitas transaction, however, the annual \nDCRA cost will initially increase to about $450 million a year.  This means that our other insurance \noperations must generate at least that much underwriting gain for our overall float to be cost-free.  That \namount is quite a hurdle but one that I believe we will clear in many, if not most, years. \n \n Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad that I promised you there would be no quiz? \n \nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \n \n Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s look, though, at a summary \nbalance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group. \n \n</p>\n<p>Balance Sheet 12/31/06 (in millions)\n    \nAssets  Liabilities and Equity  \nCash and equivalents .............................. $  1,543 Notes payable ............................ $  1,468 \nAccounts and notes receivable ............... 3,793 Other current liabilities..............     6,635\nInventory ................................................ 5,257 Total current liabilities .............. 8,103 \nOther current assets ................................        363   \nTotal current assets ................................. 10,956   \n    \nGoodwill and other intangibles............... 13,314 Deferred taxes............................ 540 \nFixed assets............................................. 8,934 Term debt and other liabilities... 3,014 \nOther assets.............................................     1,168 Equity ........................................   22,715\n $34,372  $34,372 \n</p>\n<p> 10</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Earnings Statement (in millions)\n 2006 2005 2004\nRevenues .................................................................................  $52,660 $46,896 $44,142 \nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $823 in 2006,    \n $699 in 2005 and $676 in 2004).......................................  49,002 44,190 41,604 \nInterest expense .......................................................................         132          83         57\nPre-tax earnings.......................................................................  3,526* 2,623* 2,481* \nIncome taxes and minority interests ........................................      1,395        977        941\nNet income ..............................................................................  $  2,131 $  1,646 $  1,540 \n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments. \n \n</p>\n<p>  This motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned a pleasing \n25% on average tangible net worth last year.  It\xe2\x80\x99s noteworthy also that these operations used only minor \nfinancial leverage in achieving that return.  Clearly we own some terrific businesses.  We purchased many \nof them, however, at large premiums to net worth \xe2\x80\x93 a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the \nbalance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 10.8%. \n \n Here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Bob Shaw, a remarkable entrepreneur who from a standing start built Shaw Industries into the \ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s largest carpet producer, elected last year, at age 75, to retire.  To succeed him, Bob \nrecommended Vance Bell, a 31-year veteran at Shaw, and Bob, as usual, made the right call.  \nWeakness in housing has caused the carpet business to slow.  Shaw, however, remains a \npowerhouse and a major contributor to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s earnings. \n</p>\n<p> \n\xe2\x80\xa2 MiTek, a manufacturer of connectors for roof trusses at the time we purchased it in 2001, is \n</p>\n<p>developing into a mini-conglomerate.  At the rate it is growing, in fact, \xe2\x80\x9cmini\xe2\x80\x9d may soon be \ninappropriate.  In purchasing MiTek for $420 million, we lent the company $200 million at 9% \nand bought $198 million of stock, priced at $10,000 per share.  Additionally, 55 employees bought \n2,200 shares for $22 million.  Each employee paid exactly the same price that we did, in most \ncases borrowing money to do so. \n</p>\n<p> \nAnd are they ever glad they did!  Five years later, MiTek\xe2\x80\x99s sales have tripled and the stock is \nvalued at $71,699 per share.  Despite its making 14 acquisitions, at a cost of $291 million, MiTek \nhas paid off its debt to Berkshire and holds $35 million of cash.  We celebrated the fifth \nanniversary of our purchase with a party in July.  I told the group that it would be embarrassing if \nMiTek\xe2\x80\x99s stock price soared beyond that of Berkshire \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d shares.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised, however, if \nthat happens (though Charlie and I will try to make our shares a moving target). \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Not all of our businesses are destined to increase profits.  When an industry\xe2\x80\x99s underlying \neconomics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline.  Eventually, though, \neroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance.  (As a wise friend told me long ago, \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to get a reputation as a good businessman, be sure to get into a good business.\xe2\x80\x9d)  And \nfundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry, a trend that has caused the profits \nof our Buffalo News to decline.  The skid will almost certainly continue. \n</p>\n<p> \nWhen Charlie and I were young, the newspaper business was as easy a way to make huge returns \nas existed in America.  As one not-too-bright publisher famously said, \xe2\x80\x9cI owe my fortune to two \ngreat American institutions: monopoly and nepotism.\xe2\x80\x9d  No paper in a one-paper city, however bad \nthe product or however inept the management, could avoid gushing profits. \n \nThe industry\xe2\x80\x99s staggering returns could be simply explained.  For most of the 20th Century, \nnewspapers were the primary source of information for the American public.  Whether the subject \nwas sports, finance, or politics, newspapers reigned supreme.  Just as important, their ads were the \neasiest way to find job opportunities or to learn the price of groceries at your town\xe2\x80\x99s supermarkets.   \n</p>\n<p> 11</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The great majority of families therefore felt the need for a paper every day, but understandably \nmost didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to pay for two.  Advertisers preferred the paper with the most circulation, and \nreaders tended to want the paper with the most ads and news pages.  This circularity led to a law \nof the newspaper jungle: Survival of the Fattest.  \n \nThus, when two or more papers existed in a major city (which was almost universally the case a \ncentury ago), the one that pulled ahead usually emerged as the stand-alone winner.  After \ncompetition disappeared, the paper\xe2\x80\x99s pricing power in both advertising and circulation was \nunleashed.  Typically, rates for both advertisers and readers would be raised annually \xe2\x80\x93 and the \nprofits rolled in.  For owners this was economic heaven.  (Interestingly, though papers regularly \xe2\x80\x93 \nand often in a disapproving way \xe2\x80\x93 reported on the profitability of, say, the auto or steel industries, \nthey never enlightened readers about their own Midas-like situation.  Hmmm . . .) \n \nAs long ago as my 1991 letter to shareholders, I nonetheless asserted that this insulated world was \nchanging, writing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe media businesses . . . will prove considerably less marvelous than I, the \nindustry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some publishers took \numbrage at both this remark and other warnings from me that followed.  Newspaper properties, \nmoreover, continued to sell as if they were indestructible slot machines.  In fact, many intelligent \nnewspaper executives who regularly chronicled and analyzed important worldwide events were \neither blind or indifferent to what was going on under their noses.  \n \nNow, however, almost all newspaper owners realize that they are constantly losing ground in the \nbattle for eyeballs.  Simply put, if cable and satellite broadcasting, as well as the internet, had \ncome along first, newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed. \n</p>\n<p> \nIn Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s world, Stan Lipsey does a terrific job running the Buffalo News, and I am \nenormously proud of its editor, Margaret Sullivan.  The News\xe2\x80\x99 penetration of its market is the \nhighest among that of this country\xe2\x80\x99s large newspapers.  We also do better financially than most \nmetropolitan newspapers, even though Buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s population and business trends are not good.  \nNevertheless, this operation faces unrelenting pressures that will cause profit margins to slide. \n \nTrue, we have the leading online news operation in Buffalo, and it will continue to attract more \nviewers and ads.  However, the economic potential of a newspaper internet site \xe2\x80\x93 given the many \nalternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away \xe2\x80\x93 is at best \na small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition. \n \nFor a local resident, ownership of a city\xe2\x80\x99s paper, like ownership of a sports team, still produces \ninstant prominence.  With it typically comes power and influence.  These are ruboffs that appeal to \nmany people with money.  Beyond that, civic-minded, wealthy individuals may feel that local \nownership will serve their community well. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Peter Kiewit bought the Omaha paper \nmore than 40 years ago. \n \nWe are likely therefore to see non-economic individual buyers of newspapers emerge, just as we \nhave seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises.  Aspiring press lords should be careful, \nhowever: There\xe2\x80\x99s no rule that says a newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s revenues can\xe2\x80\x99t fall below its expenses and that \nlosses can\xe2\x80\x99t mushroom.  Fixed costs are high in the newspaper business, and that\xe2\x80\x99s bad news when \nunit volume heads south.  As the importance of newspapers diminishes, moreover, the \xe2\x80\x9cpsychic\xe2\x80\x9d \nvalue of possessing one will wane, whereas owning a sports franchise will likely retain its cachet. \n \nUnless we face an irreversible cash drain, we will stick with the News, just as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we \nwould.  (Read economic principle 11, on page 76.)  Charlie and I love newspapers \xe2\x80\x93 we each read \nfive a day \xe2\x80\x93 and believe that a free and energetic press is a key ingredient for maintaining a great \ndemocracy.  We hope that some combination of print and online will ward off economic \ndoomsday for newspapers, and we will work hard in Buffalo to develop a sustainable business \nmodel.  I think we will be successful.  But the days of lush profits from our newspaper are over. \n</p>\n<p> 12</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 A much improved situation is emerging at NetJets, which sells and manages fractionally-owned \naircraft.  This company has never had a problem growing: Revenues from flight operations have \nincreased 596% since our purchase in 1998.  But profits had been erratic. \n</p>\n<p> \nOur move to Europe, which began in 1996, was particularly expensive.  After five years of \noperation there, we had acquired only 80 customers.  And by mid-year 2006 our cumulative pre-\ntax loss had risen to $212 million.  But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 \ncustomers having been added in 2005-2006.  Under Mark Booth\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant leadership, NetJets is \nnow operating profitably in Europe, and we expect the positive trend to continue. \n \nOur U.S. operation also had a good year in 2006, which led to worldwide pre-tax earnings of $143 \nmillion at NetJets last year.  We made this profit even though we suffered a loss of $19 million in \nthe first quarter. \n \nCredit Rich Santulli, along with Mark, for this turnaround.  Rich, like many of our managers, has \nno financial need to work.  But you\xe2\x80\x99d never know it.  He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely tireless \xe2\x80\x93 monitoring \noperations, making sales, and traveling the globe to constantly widen the already-enormous lead \nthat NetJets enjoys over its competitors.  Today, the value of the fleet we manage is far greater \nthan that managed by our three largest competitors combined. \n \nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a reason NetJets is the runaway leader: It offers the ultimate in safety and service.  At \nBerkshire, and at a number of our subsidiaries, NetJets aircraft are an indispensable business tool.  \nI also have a contract for personal use with NetJets and so do members of my family and most \nBerkshire directors.  (None of us, I should add, gets a discount.)  Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve flown NetJets, \nreturning to commercial flights is like going back to holding hands. \n</p>\n<p> \nRegulated Utility Business \n \n Berkshire has an 86.6% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a \nwide variety of utility operations.  The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, \nwhose 3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) \nMidAmerican Energy, which serves 706,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and \nRocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern \nRiver and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \n \n</p>\n<p>Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave \nSokol and Greg Abel.  It\xe2\x80\x99s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will make major moves only \nwhen we are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Six years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have \nunderscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have better partners. \n \n Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the \nU.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 20,300 \nagents.  Despite HomeServices\xe2\x80\x99 purchase of two operations last year, the company\xe2\x80\x99s overall volume fell \n9% to $58 billion, and profits fell 50%. \n \n The slowdown in residential real estate activity stems in part from the weakened lending practices \nof recent years.  The \xe2\x80\x9coptional\xe2\x80\x9d contracts and \xe2\x80\x9cteaser\xe2\x80\x9d rates that have been popular have allowed borrowers \nto make payments in the early years of their mortgages that fall far short of covering normal interest costs.  \nNaturally, there are few defaults when virtually nothing is required of a borrower.  As a cynic has said, \xe2\x80\x9cA \nrolling loan gathers no loss.\xe2\x80\x9d  But payments not made add to principal, and borrowers who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford \nnormal monthly payments early on are hit later with above-normal monthly obligations.  This is the Scarlett \nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara scenario: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think about that tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d  For many home owners, \xe2\x80\x9ctomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d has now arrived.  \nConsequently there is a huge overhang of offerings in several of HomeServices\xe2\x80\x99 markets. \n \n Nevertheless, we will be seeking to purchase additional brokerage operations.  A decade from \nnow, HomeServices will almost certainly be much larger. \n</p>\n<p> 13</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Here are some key figures on MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s operations: \n \n</p>\n<p> Earnings (in $ millions)\n 2006 2005\nU.K. utilities .......................................................................................................  $     338 $     308 \nIowa utility .........................................................................................................  348 288 \nWestern utilities (acquired March 21, 2006) .....................................................  356 N/A \nPipelines .............................................................................................................  376 309 \nHomeServices.....................................................................................................  74 148 \nOther (net) ..........................................................................................................        226       115\nEarnings before corporate interest and taxes ......................................................  1,718 1,168 \nInterest, other than to Berkshire .........................................................................

When we started to wind this business down early in 2002, we had \n23,218 contracts outstanding.  Now we have 197.  Our cumulative pre-tax loss from this operation totals \n$409 million, but only $5 million occurred in 2006.  Charlie says that if we had properly classified the $409 \nmillion on our 2001 balance sheet, it would have been labeled \xe2\x80\x9cGood Until Reached For.\xe2\x80\x9d  In any event, a \nShakespearean thought \xe2\x80\x93 slightly modified \xe2\x80\x93 seems appropriate for the tombstone of this derivative \nbusiness: \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n We\xe2\x80\x99ve also wound up our investment in Value Capital.  So earnings or losses from these two lines \nof business are making their final appearance in the table that annually appears in this section. \n \n Clayton Homes remains an anomaly in the manufactured-housing industry, which last year \nrecorded its lowest unit sales since 1962.  Indeed, the industry\xe2\x80\x99s volume last year was only about one-third \nthat of 1999.  Outside of Clayton, I doubt if the industry, overall, made any money in 2006. \n \n</p>\n<p>Yet Clayton earned $513 million pre-tax and paid Berkshire an additional $86 million as a fee for \nour obtaining the funds to finance Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s $10 billion portfolio of installment receivables.  Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial strength has clearly been of huge help to Clayton.  But the driving force behind the company\xe2\x80\x99s \nsuccess is Kevin Clayton.  Kevin knows the business forward and backward, is a rational decision-maker \nand a joy to work with.  Because of acquisitions, Clayton now employs 14,787 people, compared to 6,661 \nat the time of our purchase. \n \n We have two leasing operations: CORT (furniture), run by Paul Arnold, and XTRA (truck \ntrailers), run by Bill Franz.  CORT\xe2\x80\x99s earnings improved significantly last year, and XTRA\xe2\x80\x99s remained at \nthe high level attained in 2005.  We continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions to be run by Paul or Bill, and \nalso are open to ideas for new leasing opportunities. \n</p>\n<p> 14</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Here\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of earnings in this sector: \n (in millions) \n</p>\n<p>Pre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities\n 2006 2005 2006 2005\nTrading  \xe2\x80\x93 ordinary income ............................  $     274 $    200 $    600 $1,061 \nGen Re Securities (loss) .................................

Last year, we \ntold you that our expectation was that these companies, in aggregate, would increase their earnings by 6% \nto 8% annually, a rate that would double their earnings every ten years or so.  In 2006 American Express,  \n</p>\n<p> 15</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble and Wells Fargo, our largest holdings, increased per-share earnings by 18%, \n9%, 8% and 11%.  These are stellar results, and we thank their CEOs. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We\xe2\x80\x99ve come close to eliminating our direct foreign-exchange position, from which we realized \nabout $186 million in pre-tax profits in 2006 (earnings that were included in the Finance and Financial \nProducts table shown earlier).  That brought our total gain since inception of this position in 2002 to $2.2 \nbillion.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown by currency: \n \n</p>\n<p>Total Gain (Loss) in Millions\n    \nAustralian dollar $247.1 Mexican peso $106.1 \nBritish pound 287.2 New Zealand dollar 102.6 \nCanadian dollar 398.3 Singapore dollar (2.6) \nChinese yuan (12.7) South Korean won 261.3 \nEuro 839.2 Swiss franc 9.6 \nHong Kong dollar (2.5) Taiwan dollar (45.3) \nJapanese yen 1.9 Miscellaneous options 22.9 \n</p>\n<p> \n We\xe2\x80\x99ve made large indirect currency profits as well, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never tallied the precise amount.  \nFor example, in 2002-2003 we spent about $82 million buying \xe2\x80\x93 of all things \xe2\x80\x93 Enron bonds, some of \nwhich were denominated in Euros.  Already we\xe2\x80\x99ve received distributions of $179 million from these bonds, \nand our remaining stake is worth $173 million.  That means our overall gain is $270 million, part of which \ncame from the appreciation of the Euro that took place after our bond purchase. \n \n When we first began making foreign exchange purchases, interest-rate differentials between the \nU.S. and most foreign countries favored a direct currency position.  But that spread turned negative in \n2005.  We therefore looked for other ways to gain foreign-currency exposure, such as the ownership of \nforeign equities or of U.S. stocks with major earnings abroad.  The currency factor, we should emphasize, \nis not dominant in our selection of equities, but is merely one of many considerations. \n \n As our U.S. trade problems worsen, the probability that the dollar will weaken over time continues \nto be high.  I fervently believe in real trade \xe2\x80\x93 the more the better for both us and the world.  We had about \n$1.44 trillion of this honest-to-God trade in 2006.  But the U.S. also had $.76 trillion of pseudo-trade last \nyear \xe2\x80\x93 imports for which we exchanged no goods or services.  (Ponder, for a moment, how commentators \nwould describe the situation if our imports were $.76 trillion \xe2\x80\x93 a full 6% of GDP \xe2\x80\x93 and we had no exports.)  \nMaking these purchases that weren\xe2\x80\x99t reciprocated by sales, the U.S. necessarily transferred ownership of its \nassets or IOUs to the rest of the world.  Like a very wealthy but self-indulgent family, we peeled off a bit of \nwhat we owned in order to consume more than we produced. \n \n</p>\n<p>The U.S. can do a lot of this because we are an extraordinarily rich country that has behaved \nresponsibly in the past.  The world is therefore willing to accept our bonds, real estate, stocks and \nbusinesses.  And we have a vast store of these to hand over. \n \n These transfers will have consequences, however.  Already the prediction I made last year about \none fall-out from our spending binge has come true: The \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment income\xe2\x80\x9d account of our country \xe2\x80\x93 \npositive in every previous year since 1915 \xe2\x80\x93 turned negative in 2006.  Foreigners now earn more on their \nU.S. investments than we do on our investments abroad.  In effect, we\xe2\x80\x99ve used up our bank account and \nturned to our credit card.  And, like everyone who gets in hock, the U.S. will now experience \xe2\x80\x9creverse \ncompounding\xe2\x80\x9d as we pay ever-increasing amounts of interest on interest. \n \n I want to emphasize that even though our course is unwise, Americans will live better ten or \ntwenty years from now than they do today.  Per-capita wealth will increase.  But our citizens will also be \nforced every year to ship a significant portion of their current production abroad merely to service the cost \nof our huge debtor position.  It won\xe2\x80\x99t be pleasant to work part of each day to pay for the over-consumption  \n</p>\n<p> 16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>of your ancestors.  I believe that at some point in the future U.S. workers and voters will find this annual \n\xe2\x80\x9ctribute\xe2\x80\x9d so onerous that there will be a severe political backlash.  How that will play out in markets is \nimpossible to predict \xe2\x80\x93 but to expect a \xe2\x80\x9csoft landing\xe2\x80\x9d seems like wishful thinking. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n I should mention that all of the direct currency profits we have realized have come from forward \ncontracts, which are derivatives, and that we have entered into other types of derivatives contracts as well.  \nThat may seem odd, since you know of our expensive experience in unwinding the derivatives book at Gen \nRe and also have heard me talk of the systemic problems that could result from the enormous growth in the \nuse of derivatives.  Why, you may wonder, are we fooling around with such potentially toxic material? \n \n The answer is that derivatives, just like stocks and bonds, are sometimes wildly mispriced.  For \nmany years, accordingly, we have selectively written derivative contracts \xe2\x80\x93 few in number but sometimes \nfor large dollar amounts.  We currently have 62 contracts outstanding.  I manage them personally, and they \nare free of counterparty credit risk.  So far, these derivative contracts have worked out well for us, \nproducing pre-tax profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars (above and beyond the gains I\xe2\x80\x99ve itemized \nfrom forward foreign-exchange contracts).  Though we will experience losses from time to time, we are \nlikely to continue to earn \xe2\x80\x93 overall \xe2\x80\x93 significant profits from mispriced derivatives. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n I have told you that Berkshire has three outstanding candidates to replace me as CEO and that the \nBoard knows exactly who should take over if I should die tonight.  Each of the three is much younger than \nI.  The directors believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that my successor have the prospect of a long tenure. \n \n Frankly, we are not as well-prepared on the investment side of our business.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a history \nhere: At one time, Charlie was my potential replacement for investing, and more recently Lou Simpson has \nfilled that slot.  Lou is a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record of managing GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s \nequity portfolio.  But he is only six years younger than I.  If I were to die soon, he would fill in \nmagnificently for a short period.  For the long-term, though, we need a different answer. \n \n At our October board meeting, we discussed that subject fully.  And we emerged with a plan, \nwhich I will carry out with the help of Charlie and Lou. \n \n Under this plan, I intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very \nlarge portfolio, who we hope will succeed me as Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s chief investment officer when the need for \nsomeone to do that arises.  As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates. \n \n Picking the right person(s) will not be an easy task.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard, of course, to find smart people, \namong them individuals who have impressive investment records.  But there is far more to successful long-\nterm investing than brains and performance that has recently been good.   \n \n</p>\n<p>Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things.  A single, big mistake could wipe \nout a long string of successes.  We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid \nserious risks, including those never before encountered.  Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies \ncannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. \n \n</p>\n<p>Temperament is also important.  Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen \nunderstanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term investment success.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen \na lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. \n \n Finally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire.  Being able \nto list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager.  We \nwill need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choice, even though he or she could leave and make much \nmore money elsewhere. \n</p>\n<p> 17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>There are surely people who fit what we need, but they may be hard to identify.  In 1979, Jack \nByrne and I felt we had found such a person in Lou Simpson.  We then made an arrangement with him \nwhereby he would be paid well for sustained overperformance.  Under this deal, he has earned large \namounts.  Lou, however, could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous \nterms.  If money alone had been the object, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he would have done.  But Lou never \nconsidered such a move.  We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff.   \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n The good news: At 76, I feel terrific and, according to all measurable indicators, am in excellent \nhealth.  It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what Cherry Coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow. \n \nSome Changes on Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Board \n \n The composition of our board will change in two ways this spring.  One change will involve the \nChace family, which has been connected to Berkshire and its predecessor companies for more than a \ncentury.  In 1929, the first Malcolm G. Chace played an important role in merging four New England \ntextile operations into Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.  That company merged with Hathaway \nManufacturing in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway, and Malcolm G. Chace, Jr. became its chairman. \n \n Early in 1965, Malcolm arranged for Buffett Partnership Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire \nshares and welcomed us as the new controlling shareholder of the company.  Malcolm continued as non-\nexecutive chairman until 1969.  He was both a wonderful gentleman and helpful partner. \n \n That description also fits his son, Malcolm \xe2\x80\x9cKim\xe2\x80\x9d Chace, who succeeded his father on Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \nboard in 1992.  But last year Kim, now actively and successfully running a community bank that he \nfounded in 1996, suggested that we find a younger person to replace him on our board.  We have done so, \nand Kim will step down as a director at the annual meeting.  I owe much to the Chaces and wish to thank \nKim for his many years of service to Berkshire. \n \n In selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board \nmembers be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent.  I say \xe2\x80\x9ctruly\xe2\x80\x9d because many \ndirectors who are now deemed independent by various authorities and observers are far from that, relying \nheavily as they do on directors\xe2\x80\x99 fees to maintain their standard of living.  These payments, which come in \nmany forms, often range between $150,000 and $250,000 annually, compensation that may approach or \neven exceed all other income of the \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d director.  And \xe2\x80\x93 surprise, surprise \xe2\x80\x93 director \ncompensation has soared in recent years, pushed up by recommendations from corporate America\xe2\x80\x99s \nfavorite consultant, Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo.  (The name may be phony, but the action it conveys is \nnot.) \n \n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe our four criteria are essential if directors are to do their job \xe2\x80\x93 which, by law, \nis to faithfully represent owners.  Yet these criteria are usually ignored.  Instead, consultants and CEOs \nseeking board candidates will often say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca Hispanic,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csomeone from \nabroad,\xe2\x80\x9d or what have you.  It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark.  Over the years \nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he think like \nan intelligent owner?\xe2\x80\x9d   \n \n The questions I instead get would sound ridiculous to someone seeking candidates for, say, a \nfootball team, or an arbitration panel or a military command.  In those cases, the selectors would look for \npeople who had the specific talents and attitudes that were required for a specialized job.  At Berkshire, we \nare in the specialized activity of running a business well, and therefore we seek business judgment. \n \n That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve found in Susan Decker, CFO of Yahoo!, who will join our board at the \nannual meeting.  We are lucky to have her: She scores very high on our four criteria and additionally, at 44, \nis young \xe2\x80\x93 an attribute, as you may have noticed, that your Chairman has long lacked.  We will seek more \nyoung directors in the future, but never by slighting the four qualities that we insist upon. \n</p>\n<p> 18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>This and That \n \n Berkshire will pay about $4.4 billion in federal income tax on its 2006 earnings.  In its last fiscal \nyear the U.S. Government spent $2.6 trillion, or about $7 billion per day.  Thus, for more than half of one \nday, Berkshire picked up the tab for all federal expenditures, ranging from Social Security and Medicare \npayments to the cost of our armed services.  Had there been only 600 taxpayers like Berkshire, no one else \nin America would have needed to pay any federal income or payroll taxes. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Our federal return last year, we should add, ran to 9,386 pages.  To handle this filing, state and \nforeign tax returns, a myriad of SEC requirements, and all of the other matters involved in running \nBerkshire, we have gone all the way up to 19 employees at World Headquarters. \n \n This crew occupies 9,708 square feet of space, and Charlie \xe2\x80\x93 at World Headquarters West in Los \nAngeles \xe2\x80\x93 uses another 655 square feet.  Our home-office payroll, including benefits and counting both \nlocations, totaled $3,531,978 last year.  We\xe2\x80\x99re careful when spending your money. \n \n Corporate bigwigs often complain about government spending, criticizing bureaucrats who they \nsay spend taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money differently from how they would if it were their own.  But sometimes the \nfinancial behavior of executives will also vary based on whose wallet is getting depleted.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s an \nillustrative tale from my days at Salomon.  In the 1980s the company had a barber, Jimmy by name, who \ncame in weekly to give free haircuts to the top brass.  A manicurist was also on tap.  Then, because of a \ncost-cutting drive, patrons were told to pay their own way.  One top executive (not the CEO) who had \npreviously visited Jimmy weekly went immediately to a once-every-three-weeks schedule. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \nEvery now and then Charlie and I catch on early to a tide-like trend, one brimming over with \n</p>\n<p>commercial promise.  For example, though American Airlines (with its \xe2\x80\x9cmiles\xe2\x80\x9d) and American Express \n(with credit card points) are credited as being trailblazers in granting customers \xe2\x80\x9crewards,\xe2\x80\x9d Charlie and I \nwere far ahead of them in spotting the appeal of this powerful idea.  Excited by our insight, the two of us \njumped into the reward business way back in 1970 by buying control of a trading stamp operation, Blue \nChip Stamps.  In that year, Blue Chip had sales of $126 million, and its stamps papered California. \n \n</p>\n<p>In 1970, indeed, about 60 billion of our stamps were licked by savers, pasted into books, and taken \nto Blue Chip redemption stores.  Our catalog of rewards was 116 pages thick and chock full of tantalizing \nitems.  When I was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons, I felt I had \nfinally found a sure thing. \n \n</p>\n<p>Well, not quite.  From the day Charlie and I stepped into the Blue Chip picture, the business went \nstraight downhill.  By 1980, sales had fallen to $19.4 million.  And, by 1990, sales were bumping along at \n$1.5 million.  No quitter, I redoubled my managerial efforts. \n \n Sales then fell another 98%.  Last year, in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s $98 billion of revenues, all of $25,920 (no \nzeros omitted) came from Blue Chip.  Ever hopeful, Charlie and I soldier on. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n I mentioned last year that in my service on 19 corporate boards (not counting Berkshire or other \ncontrolled companies), I have been the Typhoid Mary of compensation committees.  At only one company \nwas I assigned to comp committee duty, and then I was promptly outvoted on the most crucial decision that \nwe faced.  My ostracism has been peculiar, considering that I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t lacked experience in setting \nCEO pay.  At Berkshire, after all, I am a one-man compensation committee who determines the salaries \nand incentives for the CEOs of around 40 significant operating businesses. \n</p>\n<p> 19</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> How much time does this aspect of my job take?  Virtually none.  How many CEOs have \nvoluntarily left us for other jobs in our 42-year history?  Precisely none. \n \n Berkshire employs many different incentive arrangements, with their terms depending on such \nelements as the economic potential or capital intensity of a CEO\xe2\x80\x99s business.  Whatever the compensation \narrangement, though, I try to keep it both simple and fair. \n \n</p>\n<p>When we use incentives \xe2\x80\x93 and these can be large \xe2\x80\x93 they are always tied to the operating results for \nwhich a given CEO has authority.  We issue no lottery tickets that carry payoffs unrelated to business \nperformance.  If a CEO bats .300, he gets paid for being a .300 hitter, even if circumstances outside of his \ncontrol cause Berkshire to perform poorly.  And if he bats .150, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a payoff just because the \nsuccesses of others have enabled Berkshire to prosper mightily.  An example:  We now own $61 billion of \nequities at Berkshire, whose value can easily rise or fall by 10% in a given year.  Why in the world should \nthe pay of our operating executives be affected by such $6 billion swings, however important the gain or \nloss may be for shareholders? \n \n You\xe2\x80\x99ve read loads about CEOs who have received astronomical compensation for mediocre \nresults.  Much less well-advertised is the fact that America\xe2\x80\x99s CEOs also generally live the good life.  Many, \nit should be emphasized, are exceptionally able, and almost all work far more than 40 hours a week.  But \nthey are usually treated like royalty in the process.  (And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to keep it that way at \nBerkshire.  Though Charlie still favors sackcloth and ashes, I prefer to be spoiled rotten.  Berkshire owns \nThe Pampered Chef; our wonderful office group has made me The Pampered Chief.) \n \n CEO perks at one company are quickly copied elsewhere.  \xe2\x80\x9cAll the other kids have one\xe2\x80\x9d may seem \na thought too juvenile to use as a rationale in the boardroom.  But consultants employ precisely this \nargument, phrased more elegantly of course, when they make recommendations to comp committees. \n \n Irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by \n\xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d comp committee members.  Indeed, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that the reason I was rejected for \nservice on so many comp committees was that I was regarded as too independent.  Compensation reform \nwill only occur if the largest institutional shareholders \xe2\x80\x93 it would only take a few \xe2\x80\x93 demand a fresh look at \nthe whole system.  The consultants\xe2\x80\x99 present drill of deftly selecting \xe2\x80\x9cpeer\xe2\x80\x9d companies to compare with their \nclients will only perpetuate present excesses. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Last year I arranged for the bulk of my Berkshire holdings to go to five charitable foundations, \nthus carrying out part of my lifelong plan to eventually use all of my shares for philanthropic purposes.  \nDetails of the commitments I made, as well as the rationale for them, are posted on our website, \nwww.berkshirehathaway.com.  Taxes, I should note, had nothing to do with my decision or its timing.  My \nfederal and state income taxes in 2006 were exactly what they would have been had I not made my first \ncontributions last summer, and the same point will apply to my 2007 contributions. \n \n In my will I\xe2\x80\x99ve stipulated that the proceeds from all Berkshire shares I still own at death are to be \nused for philanthropic purposes within ten years after my estate is closed.  Because my affairs are not \ncomplicated, it should take three years at most for this closing to occur.  Adding this 13-year period to my \nexpected lifespan of about 12 years (though, naturally, I\xe2\x80\x99m aiming for more) means that proceeds from all \nof my Berkshire shares will likely be distributed for societal purposes over the next 25 years or so. \n \n</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve set this schedule because I want the money to be spent relatively promptly by people I know \nto be capable, vigorous and motivated.  These managerial attributes sometimes wane as institutions \xe2\x80\x93 \nparticularly those that are exempt from market forces \xe2\x80\x93 age.  Today, there are terrific people in charge at \nthe five foundations.  So at my death, why should they not move with dispatch to judiciously spend the \nmoney that remains? \n</p>\n<p> 20</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="annotation"><a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/</a></div>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Those people favoring perpetual foundations argue that in the future there will most certainly be \nlarge and important societal problems that philanthropy will need to address.  I agree.  But there will then \nalso be many super-rich individuals and families whose wealth will exceed that of today\xe2\x80\x99s Americans and \nto whom philanthropic organizations can make their case for funding.  These funders can then judge \nfirsthand which operations have both the vitality and the focus to best address the major societal problems \nthat then exist.  In this way, a market test of ideas and effectiveness can be applied.  Some organizations \nwill deserve major support while others will have outlived their usefulness.  Even if the people above \nground make their decisions imperfectly, they should be able to allocate funds more rationally than a \ndecedent six feet under will have ordained decades earlier.  Wills, of course, can always be rewritten, but \nit\xe2\x80\x99s very unlikely that my thinking will change in a material way. \n \n A few shareholders have expressed concern that sales of Berkshire by the foundations receiving \nshares will depress the stock.  These fears are unwarranted.  The annual trading volume of many stocks \nexceeds 100% of the outstanding shares, but nevertheless these stocks usually sell at prices approximating \ntheir intrinsic value.  Berkshire also tends to sell at an appropriate price, but with annual volume that is only \n15% of shares outstanding.  At most, sales by the foundations receiving my shares will add three \npercentage points to annual trading volume, which will still leave Berkshire with a turnover ratio that is the \nlowest around. \n \n</p>\n<p>Overall, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s business performance will determine the price of our stock, and most of the \ntime it will sell in a zone of reasonableness.  It\xe2\x80\x99s important that the foundations receive appropriate prices \nas they periodically sell Berkshire shares, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also important that incoming shareholders don\xe2\x80\x99t overpay.  \n(See economic principle 14 on page 77.)  By both our policies and shareholder communications, Charlie \nand I will do our best to ensure that Berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor large premium to intrinsic \nvalue. \n</p>\n<p> \n The existence of foundation ownership will in no way influence our board\xe2\x80\x99s decisions about \ndividends, repurchases, or the issuance of shares.  We will follow exactly the same rule that has guided us \nin the past: What action will be likely to deliver the best result for shareholders over time? \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * \n In last year\xe2\x80\x99s report I allegorically described the Gotrocks family \xe2\x80\x93 a clan that owned all of \nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s businesses and that counterproductively attempted to increase its investment returns by paying \never-greater commissions and fees to \xe2\x80\x9chelpers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sad to say, the \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d continued its self-destructive \nways in 2006. \n \n In part the family persists in this folly because it harbors unrealistic expectations about obtainable \nreturns.  Sometimes these delusions are self-serving.  For example, private pension plans can temporarily \noverstate their earnings, and public pension plans can defer the need for increased taxes, by using \ninvestment assumptions that are likely to be out of reach.  Actuaries and auditors go along with these \ntactics, and it can be decades before the chickens come home to roost (at which point the CEO or public \nofficial who misled the world is apt to be gone). \n \n Meanwhile, Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s Pied Pipers of Performance will have encouraged the futile hopes of the \nfamily. The hapless Gotrocks will be assured that they all can achieve above-average investment \nperformance \xe2\x80\x93 but only by paying ever-higher fees.  Call this promise the adult version of Lake Woebegon. \n \n</p>\n<p>In 2006, promises and fees hit new highs.  A flood of money went from institutional investors to \nthe 2-and-20 crowd.  For those innocent of this arrangement, let me explain: It\xe2\x80\x99s a lopsided system whereby \n2% of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing \xe2\x80\x93 or, for that matter, \nloses you a bundle \xe2\x80\x93 and, additionally, 20% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds, even if his success \nis due simply to a rising tide.  For example, a manager who achieves a gross return of 10% in a year will \nkeep 3.6 percentage points \xe2\x80\x93 two points off the top plus 20% of the residual 8 points \xe2\x80\x93 leaving only 6.4 \npercentage points for his investors.  On a $3 billion fund, this 6.4% net \xe2\x80\x9cperformance\xe2\x80\x9d will deliver the \nmanager a cool $108 million.  He will receive this bonanza even though an index fund might have returned \n15% to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. \n</p>\n<p> 21</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '21': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The inexorable math of this grotesque arrangement is certain to make the Gotrocks family poorer \nover time than it would have been had it never heard of these \xe2\x80\x9chyper-helpers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even so, the 2-and-20 \naction spreads.  Its effects bring to mind the old adage: When someone with experience proposes a deal to \nsomeone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with \nexperience ends up with the money. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Let me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of Wall Street, my long-time \nfriend Walter Schloss, who last year turned 90.  From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably \nsuccessful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unless his investors made money.  My \nadmiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight.  A full fifty years ago, Walter was my \nsole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. \n \n Walter did not go to business school, or for that matter, college.  His office contained one file \ncabinet in 1956; the number mushroomed to four by 2002.  Walter worked without a secretary, clerk or \nbookkeeper, his only associate being his son, Edwin, a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts.  \nWalter and Edwin never came within a mile of inside information.  Indeed, they used \xe2\x80\x9coutside\xe2\x80\x9d information \nonly sparingly, generally selecting securities by certain simple statistical methods Walter learned while \nworking for Ben Graham.  When Walter and Edwin were asked in 1989 by Outstanding Investors Digest, \n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would you summarize your approach?\xe2\x80\x9d Edwin replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWe try to buy stocks cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d  So much for \nModern Portfolio Theory, technical analysis, macroeconomic thoughts and complex algorithms. \n \n Following a strategy that involved no real risk \xe2\x80\x93 defined as permanent loss of capital \xe2\x80\x93 Walter \nproduced results over his 47 partnership years that dramatically surpassed those of the S&amp;P 500.  It\xe2\x80\x99s \nparticularly noteworthy that he built this record by investing in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a \nlackluster type.  A few big winners did not account for his success.  It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that had millions of \ninvestment managers made trades by a) drawing stock names from a hat; b) purchasing these stocks in \ncomparable amounts when Walter made a purchase; and then c) selling when Walter sold his pick, the \nluckiest of them would not have come close to equaling his record.  There is simply no possibility that what \nWalter achieved over 47 years was due to chance. \n \n I first publicly discussed Walter\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable record in 1984.  At that time \xe2\x80\x9cefficient market \ntheory\xe2\x80\x9d (EMT) was the centerpiece of investment instruction at most major business schools.  This theory, \nas then most commonly taught, held that the price of any stock at any moment is not demonstrably \nmispriced, which means that no investor can be expected to overperform the stock market averages using \nonly publicly-available information (though some will do so by luck).  When I talked about Walter 23 years \nago, his record forcefully contradicted this dogma. \n \n</p>\n<p>And what did members of the academic community do when they were exposed to this new and \nimportant evidence?  Unfortunately, they reacted in all-too-human fashion: Rather than opening their \nminds, they closed their eyes.  To my knowledge no business school teaching EMT made any attempt to \nstudy Walter\xe2\x80\x99s performance and what it meant for the school\xe2\x80\x99s cherished theory.    \n \n Instead, the faculties of the schools went merrily on their way presenting EMT as having the \ncertainty of scripture.  Typically, a finance instructor who had the nerve to question EMT had about as \nmuch chance of major promotion as Galileo had of being named Pope. \n \n Tens of thousands of students were therefore sent out into life believing that on every day the price \nof every stock was \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d (or, more accurately, not demonstrably wrong) and that attempts to evaluate \nbusinesses \xe2\x80\x93 that is, stocks \xe2\x80\x93 were useless.  Walter meanwhile went on overperforming, his job made easier \nby the misguided instructions that had been given to those young minds.  After all, if you are in the \nshipping business, it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to have all of your potential competitors be taught that the earth is flat. \n \n Maybe it was a good thing for his investors that Walter didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to college. \n</p>\n<p> 22</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '22': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting \n \n Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 5th.   As always, the doors will open at the \nQwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to \nthe question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\xe2\x80\x99s stands) will last until 3:00.  \nThen, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.  If you decide to leave \nduring the day\xe2\x80\x99s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. \n \n The best reason to exit, of course is to shop.  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300 \nsquare foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries.  Last year, the \n24,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales.  \nBut records are made to be broken, and I know you can do better. \n \n This year we will again showcase a Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that the home, \npriced at $139,900, delivers excellent value.  Last year, a helper at the Qwest bought one of two homes on \ndisplay well before we opened the doors to shareholders.  Flanking the Clayton home on the exhibition \nfloor this year will be an RV and pontoon boat from Forest River. \n \n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \nyou money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.  And while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \ncredit card.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the one I now use (sparingly, of course). \n \n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available \nfor your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to \nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel that you wish on board with you. \n \n In the Bookworm\xe2\x80\x99s corner of our bazaar, there will be about 25 books and DVDs \xe2\x80\x93 all discounted \n\xe2\x80\x93 led again by Poor Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack.  (One hapless soul last year asked Charlie what he should do if he \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy the book.  Back came a Mungerism: \xe2\x80\x9cNo problem \xe2\x80\x93 just give it to someone more intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d)  \nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve added a few titles this year.  Among them are Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger by Peter \nBevelin, a long-time Swedish shareholder of Berkshire, and Fred Schwed\xe2\x80\x99s classic, Where are the \nCustomers\xe2\x80\x99 Yachts?  This book was first published in 1940 and is now in its 4th edition.  The funniest book \never written about investing, it lightly delivers many truly important messages on the subject. \n \n An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel \nrooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. \n \n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \nwe will again be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM ten \nyears ago, and sales during the \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend\xe2\x80\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30 million in 2006.  I get \ngoose bumps just thinking about this volume. \n \n To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 3rd and \nMonday, May 7th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will \neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We \nappreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.  \n</p>\n<p> 23</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '23': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>to 6 p.m. on Sunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a special shareholder \npicnic featuring chicken and beef tacos (and hamburgers for traditionalists like me). \n \n At a remodeled and expanded Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, we will again have two shareholder-only events.  The \nfirst will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 4th.  The second, the main gala, will \nbe held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \n \n We will have huge crowds at Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, \ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30th through Saturday, May 12th.  \nDuring that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a \nbrokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder. \n \n On Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess \nchampion, will take on all comers \xe2\x80\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \xe2\x80\x93 in groups of six.  Last year I \ncarried on a conversation with Patrick while he played in this manner.  Nearby, Norman Beck, a \nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.  Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and \nSharon Osberg, two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on \nSunday afternoon. \n \n To add to the Sunday fun at Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, Ariel Hsing will play table tennis (ping-pong to the \nuninitiated) from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. against anyone brave enough to take her on.  Ariel, though only 11, is \nranked number one among girls under 16 in the U.S. (and number 1 among both boys and girls under 12).  \nThe week I turned 75 I played Ariel, then 9 and barely tall enough to see across the table, thinking I would \ntake it easy on her so as not to crush her young spirit.  Instead she crushed me.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve since devised a plan \nthat will give me a chance against her.  At 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will initiate play with a 2-point game against \nAriel.  If I somehow win the first point, I will then feign injury and claim victory.  After this strenuous \nencounter wears Ariel down, our shareholders can then try their luck against her. \n \n Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6th, and will be \nserving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on that day, you must have a \nreservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before).   \n \n In the 2006-2007 school year, 35 university classes, including one from IBMEC in Brazil, will \ncome to Omaha for sessions with me.  I take almost all \xe2\x80\x93 in aggregate, more than 2,000 students \xe2\x80\x93 to lunch \nat Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s.  And they love it.  To learn why, come join us on Sunday. \n \n We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come \nfrom outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and \nCharlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed \nmeeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other \nthan the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Charlie and I are extraordinarily lucky.  We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw \nthat we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a \n\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who \ncontribute as much or more to our society\xe2\x80\x99s well-being.  Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in \nwhich we are helped every day in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates.  No wonder we tap-\ndance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at \nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting.  So join us on May 5th at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  \nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see you there. \n \nFebruary 28, 2007    Warren E.
