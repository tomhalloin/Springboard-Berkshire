The components of that figure are $24 billion of operating earnings, $3.7 billion of realized capital\ngains and a $53.7 billion gain from an increase in the amount of net unrealized capital gains that exist in the stocks\nwe hold. Each of those components of earnings is stated on an after-tax basis.\n</p>\n<p>That $53.7 billion gain requires comment. It resulted from a new GAAP rule, imposed in 2018, that requires\na company holding equity securities to include in earnings the net change in the unrealized gains and losses of those\nsecurities. As we stated in last year\xe2\x80\x99s letter, neither Charlie Munger, my partner in managing Berkshire, nor I agree\nwith that rule.\n</p>\n<p>The adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking.\nBefore 2018, GAAP insisted \xe2\x80\x93 with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities \xe2\x80\x93 that\nunrealized gains within a portfolio of stocks were never to be included in earnings and unrealized losses were to be\nincluded only if they were deemed \xe2\x80\x9cother than temporary.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter\xe2\x80\x99s bottom\nline \xe2\x80\x93 a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators \xe2\x80\x93 every up and down movement of the stocks\nit owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a down\nyear for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreased by $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP\nearnings of only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7\nbillion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrations\nled to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!\n</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in what we might call the real world, as opposed to accounting-land, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s equity holdings\naveraged about $200 billion during the two years, and the intrinsic value of the stocks we own grew steadily and\nsubstantially throughout the period.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings \xe2\x80\x93 which were little changed in 2019 \xe2\x80\x93 and to ignore\nboth quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized.\n</p>\n<p>Our advising that in no way diminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie\nand I expect our equity holdings \xe2\x80\x93 as a group \xe2\x80\x93 to deliver major gains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular\nmanner. To see why we are optimistic, move on to the next discussion.\n</p>\n<p>The Power of Retained Earnings\n</p>\n<p>In 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long\nTerm Investments, a slim book that changed the investment world. Indeed, writing the book changed Smith himself,\nforcing him to reassess his own investment beliefs.\n</p>\n<p>Going in, he planned to argue that stocks would perform better than bonds during inflationary periods and\nthat bonds would deliver superior returns during deflationary times. That seemed sensible enough. But Smith was in\nfor a shock.\n</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>His book began, therefore, with a confession: \xe2\x80\x9cThese studies are the record of a failure \xe2\x80\x93 the failure of facts\nto sustain a preconceived theory.\xe2\x80\x9d Luckily for investors, that failure led Smith to think more deeply about how stocks\nshould be evaluated.\n</p>\n<p>For the crux of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard\nKeynes: \xe2\x80\x9cI have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s most important, and is certainly his most novel, point.\nWell-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits.\nIn good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is\nan element of compound interest (Keynes\xe2\x80\x99 italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a period\nof years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from the\ndividends paid out to the shareholders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>And with that sprinkling of holy water, Smith was no longer obscure.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to understand why retained earnings were unappreciated by investors before Smith\xe2\x80\x99s book was\npublished. After all, it was no secret that mind-boggling wealth had earlier been amassed by such titans as Carnegie,\nRockefeller and Ford, all of whom had retained a huge portion of their business earnings to fund growth and produce\never-greater profits. Throughout America, also, there had long been small-time capitalists who became rich following\nthe same playbook.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when business ownership was sliced into small pieces \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cstocks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 buyers in the pre-Smith\nyears usually thought of their shares as a short-term gamble on market movements. Even at their best, stocks were\nconsidered speculations. Gentlemen preferred bonds.\n</p>\n<p>Though investors were slow to wise up, the math of retaining and reinvesting earnings is now well\nunderstood. Today, school children learn what Keynes termed \xe2\x80\x9cnovel\xe2\x80\x9d: combining savings with compound interest\nworks wonders.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I have long focused on using retained earnings advantageously. Sometimes this\n</p>\n<p>job has been easy \xe2\x80\x93 at other times, more than difficult, particularly when we began working with huge and ever-\ngrowing sums of money.\n</p>\n<p>In our deployment of the funds we retain, we first seek to invest in the many and diverse businesses we\nalready own. During the past decade, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s internal investments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment in\nproductive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, we constantly seek to buy new businesses that meet three criteria. First, they must earn good\nreturns on the net tangible capital required in their operation. Second, they must be run by able and honest managers.\nFinally, they must be available at a sensible price.\n</p>\n<p>When we spot such businesses, our preference would be to buy 100% of them. But the opportunities to make\nmajor acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare. Far more often, a fickle stock market serves up\nopportunities for us to buy large, but non-controlling, positions in publicly-traded companies that meet our standards.\n</p>\n<p>Whichever way we go \xe2\x80\x93 controlled companies or only a major stake by way of the stock market \xe2\x80\x93 Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nfinancial results from the commitment will in large part be determined by the future earnings of the business we have\npurchased. Nonetheless, there is between the two investment approaches a hugely important accounting difference,\nessential for you to understand.\n</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>In our controlled companies, (defined as those in which Berkshire owns more than 50% of the shares), the\nearnings of each business flow directly into the operating earnings that we report to you. What you see is what you\nget.\n</p>\n<p>In the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, only the dividends that Berkshire\nreceives are recorded in the operating earnings we report. The retained earnings? They\xe2\x80\x99re working hard and creating\nmuch added value, but not in a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s reported earnings.\n</p>\n<p>At almost all major companies other than Berkshire, investors would not find what we\xe2\x80\x99ll call this \xe2\x80\x9cnon-\nrecognition of earnings\xe2\x80\x9d important. For us, however, it is a standout omission, of a magnitude that we lay out for you\nbelow.\n</p>\n<p>Here, we list our 10 largest stock-market holdings of businesses. The list distinguishes between their earnings\nthat are reported to you under GAAP accounting \xe2\x80\x93 these are the dividends Berkshire receives from those 10 investees\n\xe2\x80\x93 and our share, so to speak, of the earnings the investees retain and put to work. Normally, those companies use\nretained earnings to expand their business and increase its efficiency. Or sometimes they use those funds to repurchase\nsignificant portions of their own stock, an act that enlarges Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s share of the company\xe2\x80\x99s future earnings.\n</p>\n<p>Yearend\nOwnership\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Share (in millions)\n</p>\n<p>Company Dividends(1) Retained Earnings(2)\n</p>\n<p>American Express 18.7% $ 261 $ 998\nApple 5.7% 773 2,519\nBank of America 10.7% 682 2,167\nBank of New York Mellon 9.0% 101 288\nCoca-Cola 9.3% 640 194\nDelta Airlines 11.0% 114 416\nJ.P.

Sometimes, alas, retentions produce nothing. But both\nlogic and our past experience indicate that from the group we will realize capital gains at least equal to \xe2\x80\x93 and probably\nbetter than \xe2\x80\x93 the earnings of ours that they retained. (When we sell shares and realize gains, we will pay income tax on\nthe gain at whatever rate then prevails. Currently, the federal rate is 21%.)\n</p>\n<p>It is certain that Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s rewards from these 10 companies, as well as those from our many other equity\nholdings, will manifest themselves in a highly irregular manner. Periodically, there will be losses, sometimes\ncompany-specific, sometimes linked to stock-market swoons. At other times \xe2\x80\x93 last year was one of those \xe2\x80\x93 our gain\nwill be outsized. Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of major importance in the growth of\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s value.\n</p>\n<p>Mr. Smith got it right.\n</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Non-Insurance Operations\n</p>\n<p>Tom Murphy, a valued director of Berkshire and an all-time great among business managers, long ago gave\nme some important advice about acquisitions: \xe2\x80\x9cTo achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy good\nbusinesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Over the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cgood\nbusinesses.\xe2\x80\x9d Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, on\nthe other hand, have exceeded my hopes.\n</p>\n<p>In reviewing my uneven record, I\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course,\nwith a joyful wedding \xe2\x80\x93 but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, the\nnew union delivers bliss beyond either party\xe2\x80\x99s hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those images\nto corporate acquisitions, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get\ndreamy-eyed during corporate courtships.\n</p>\n<p>Pursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy\nwith the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number,\nhowever, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed.\n</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by most\nbusinesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the \xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in which\nits operations require an ever-smaller percentage of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s capital. Meanwhile, our \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d businesses often tend\nto grow and find opportunities for investing additional capital at attractive rates. Because of these contrasting\ntrajectories, the assets employed at Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s winners gradually become an expanding portion of our total capital.\n</p>\n<p>As an extreme example of those financial movements, witness Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s original textile business. When\nwe acquired control of the company in early 1965, this beleaguered operation required nearly all of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s capital.\nFor some time, therefore, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s non-earning textile assets were a huge drag on our overall returns. Eventually,\nthough, we acquired a spread of \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d businesses, a shift that by the early 1980s caused the dwindling textile\noperation to employ only a tiny portion of our capital.\n</p>\n<p>Today, we have most of your money deployed in controlled businesses that achieve good-to-excellent returns\non the net tangible assets each requires for its operations. Our insurance business has been the superstar. That operation\nhas special characteristics that give it a unique metric for calibrating success, one unfamiliar to many investors. We\nwill save that discussion for the next section.\n</p>\n<p>In the paragraphs that follow, we group our wide array of non-insurance businesses by size of earnings, after\ninterest, depreciation, taxes, non-cash compensation, restructuring charges \xe2\x80\x93 all of those pesky, but very real, costs\nthat CEOs and Wall Street sometimes urge investors to ignore. Additional information about these operations can be\nfound on pages K-6 \xe2\x80\x93 K-21 and pages K-40 \xe2\x80\x93 K-52.\n</p>\n<p>Our BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (\xe2\x80\x9cBHE\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x93 the two lead dogs of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s non-\ninsurance group \xe2\x80\x93 earned a combined $8.3 billion in 2019 (including only our 91% share of BHE), an increase of 6%\nfrom 2018.\n</p>\n<p>Our next five non-insurance subsidiaries, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically), Clayton\nHomes, International Metalworking, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts, had aggregate earnings in 2019 of\n$4.8 billion, little changed from what these companies earned in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Johns Manville, NetJets, Shaw\nand TTI) earned $1.9 billion last year, up from the $1.7 billion earned by this tier in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns \xe2\x80\x93 and there are many \xe2\x80\x93 had aggregate earnings\nof $2.7 billion in 2019, down from $2.8 billion in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>Our total net income in 2019 from the non-insurance businesses we control amounted to $17.7 billion, an\nincrease of 3% from the $17.2 billion this group earned in 2018. Acquisitions and dispositions had almost no net effect\non these results.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>I must add one final item that underscores the wide scope of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s operations. Since 2011, we have\nowned Lubrizol, an Ohio-based company that produces and markets oil additives throughout the world. On September\n26, 2019, a fire originating at a small next-door operation spread to a large French plant owned by Lubrizol.\n</p>\n<p>The result was significant property damage and a major disruption in Lubrizol\xe2\x80\x99s business. Even so, both the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s property loss and business-interruption loss will be mitigated by substantial insurance recoveries that\nLubrizol will receive.\n</p>\n<p>But, as the late Paul Harvey was given to saying in his famed radio broadcasts, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the rest of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne of the largest insurers of Lubrizol was a company owned by . . . uh, Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>In Matthew 6:3, the Bible instructs us to \xe2\x80\x9cLet not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.\xe2\x80\x9d Your\nchairman has clearly behaved as ordered.\n</p>\n<p>Property/Casualty Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Our property/casualty (\xe2\x80\x9cP/C\xe2\x80\x9d) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s growth since\n1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire &amp; Marine, for $8.6 million.\nToday, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company in the world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a business\nof promises, and Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.\n</p>\n<p>One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry\xe2\x80\x99s business model: P/C insurers receive\npremiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe\nworkplace accidents, payments can stretch over many decades.\n</p>\n<p>This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums \xe2\x80\x93 money we call \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that\nwill eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual\npolicies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to\npremium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following\ntable shows:\n</p>\n<p>Year Float (in millions)\n</p>\n<p>1970 $ 39\n1980 237\n1990 1,632\n2000 27,871\n2010 65,832\n2018 122,732\n2019 129,423\n</p>\n<p>We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual \xe2\x80\x93 at the outside no more\nthan 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-\nterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key\ncomponent in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That strength will never be compromised.\n</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an\nunderwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the\nuse of free money \xe2\x80\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\n</p>\n<p>For the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nbecause the standard investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily \xe2\x80\x93 and properly \xe2\x80\x93 skewed toward\nhigh-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decade\nthe bond market has offered pathetically low rates.\n</p>\n<p>Consequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced \xe2\x80\x93 by maturities or issuer-call provisions \xe2\x80\x93\nto recycle their \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurers\ncould safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less if\ntheir operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never land of negative rates).\n</p>\n<p>Some insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid\n\xe2\x80\x9calternative\xe2\x80\x9d investments promising higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutions\nare ill-equipped to play.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled\nmountain of capital, abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more\ninvestment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry. The many choices open to us are\nalways advantageous \xe2\x80\x93 and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities.\n</p>\n<p>Our P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an\nunderwriting profit for 16 of the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2\nbillion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain totaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.\n</p>\n<p>That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who\nknow that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service.\nAt Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\n</p>\n<p>As I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a\nsure thing: We will most certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.\n</p>\n<p>Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years \xe2\x80\x93 even decades \xe2\x80\x93 to surface and\nripen. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps\ntomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big One\xe2\x80\x9d may come from a traditional source, such as wind or\nearthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything\ninsurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the losses and they\nwill be big \xe2\x80\x93 very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our\nresources, and we will be eager to add to our business the next day.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Close your eyes for a moment and try to envision a locale that might spawn a dynamic P/C insurer. New\nYork? London? Silicon Valley?\n</p>\n<p>How about Wilkes-Barre?\n</p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Late in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he was\nbuying a tiny company \xe2\x80\x93 GUARD Insurance Group \xe2\x80\x93 in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its net\nworth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD and\nSy were new names to me.\n</p>\n<p>Bingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and also\ndelivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new products\nand new regions of the country and has increased GUARD\xe2\x80\x99s float by 265%.\n</p>\n<p>In 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant. Wilkes-Barre may well deliver a similar\nsurprise.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway Energy\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway Energy is now celebrating its 20th year under our ownership. That anniversary suggests\nthat we should be catching up with the company\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments.\n</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the topic of electricity rates. When Berkshire entered the utility business in 2000, purchasing\n76% of BHE, the company\xe2\x80\x99s residential customers in Iowa paid an average of 8.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\nPrices for residential customers have since risen less than 1% a year, and we have promised that there will be no base\nrate price increases through 2028. In contrast, here\xe2\x80\x99s what is happening at the other large investor-owned Iowa utility:\nLast year, the rates it charged its residential customers were 61% higher than BHE\xe2\x80\x99s. Recently, that utility received a\nrate increase that will widen the gap to 70%.\n</p>\n<p>The extraordinary differential between our rates and theirs is largely the result of our huge accomplishments\nin converting wind into electricity. In 2021, we expect BHE\xe2\x80\x99s operation to generate about 25.2 million megawatt-hours\nof electricity (MWh) in Iowa from wind turbines that it both owns and operates. That output will totally cover the\nannual needs of its Iowa customers, which run to about 24.6 million MWh. In other words, our utility will have attained\nwind self-sufficiency in the state of Iowa.\n</p>\n<p>In still another contrast, that other Iowa utility generates less than 10% of its power from wind. Furthermore,\nwe know of no other investor-owned utility, wherever located, that by 2021 will have achieved a position of wind\nself-sufficiency. In 2000, BHE was serving an agricultural-based economy; today, three of its five largest customers\nare high-tech giants. I believe their decisions to site plants in Iowa were in part based upon BHE\xe2\x80\x99s ability to deliver\nrenewable, low-cost energy.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, wind is intermittent, and our blades in Iowa turn only part of the time. In certain periods, when\nthe air is still, we look to our non-wind generating capacity to secure the electricity we need. At opposite times, we\nsell the excess power that wind provides us to other utilities, serving them through what\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cthe grid.\xe2\x80\x9d The power\nwe sell them supplants their need for a carbon resource \xe2\x80\x93 coal, say, or natural gas.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway now owns 91% of BHE in partnership with Walter Scott, Jr. and Greg Abel. BHE has\nnever paid Berkshire Hathaway a dividend since our purchase and has, as the years have passed, retained $28 billion\nof earnings. That pattern is an outlier in the world of utilities, whose companies customarily pay big dividends \xe2\x80\x93\nsometimes reaching, or even exceeding, 80% of earnings. Our view: The more we can invest, the more we like it.\n</p>\n<p>Today, BHE has the operating talent and experience to manage truly huge utility projects \xe2\x80\x93 requiring\ninvestments of $100 billion or more \xe2\x80\x93 that could support infrastructure benefitting our country, our communities and\nour shareholders. We stand ready, willing and able to take on such opportunities.\n</p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Investments\n</p>\n<p>Below we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

Occasionally,\nthere will be major drops in the market, perhaps of 50% magnitude or even greater.

Others? Beware!\n</p>\n<p>The Road Ahead\n</p>\n<p>Three decades ago, my Midwestern friend, Joe Rosenfield, then in his 80s, received an irritating letter from\nhis local newspaper. In blunt words, the paper asked for biographical data it planned to use in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s obituary. Joe\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t respond. So? A month later, he got a second letter from the paper, this one labeled \xe2\x80\x9cURGENT.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone. That\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshire\nshareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.\n</p>\n<p>The two of us base our optimism upon five factors. First, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s assets are deployed in an extraordinary\nvariety of wholly or partly-owned businesses that, averaged out, earn attractive returns on the capital they use. Second,\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s positioning of its \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled\xe2\x80\x9d businesses within a single entity endows it with some important and\nenduring economic advantages. Third, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s financial affairs will unfailingly be managed in a manner allowing\nthe company to withstand external shocks of an extreme nature. Fourth, we possess skilled and devoted top managers\nfor whom running Berkshire is far more than simply having a high-paying and/or prestigious job. Finally, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\ndirectors \xe2\x80\x93 your guardians \xe2\x80\x93 are constantly focused on both the welfare of owners and the nurturing of a culture that\nis rare among giant corporations. (The value of this culture is explored in Margin of Trust, a new book by Larry\nCunningham and Stephanie Cuba that will be available at our annual meeting.)\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I have very pragmatic reasons for wanting to assure Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity in the years following\nour exit: The Mungers have Berkshire holdings that dwarf any of the family\xe2\x80\x99s other investments, and I have a full 99%\nof my net worth lodged in Berkshire stock. I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so. My only disposal\nof Berkshire shares, aside from charitable donations and minor personal gifts, took place in 1980, when I, along with\nother Berkshire stockholders who elected to participate, exchanged some of our Berkshire shares for the shares of an\nIllinois bank that Berkshire had purchased in 1969 and that, in 1980, needed to be offloaded because of changes in the\nbank holding company law.\n</p>\n<p>Today, my will specifically directs its executors \xe2\x80\x93 as well as the trustees who will succeed them in\nadministering my estate after the will is closed \xe2\x80\x93 not to sell any Berkshire shares. My will also absolves both the\nexecutors and the trustees from liability for maintaining what obviously will be an extreme concentration of assets.\n</p>\n<p>The will goes on to instruct the executors \xe2\x80\x93 and, in time, the trustees \xe2\x80\x93 to each year convert a portion of my\nA shares into B shares and then distribute the Bs to various foundations. Those foundations will be required to deploy\ntheir grants promptly. In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold at\nmy death to move into the market.\n</p>\n<p>Absent my will\xe2\x80\x99s directive that all my Berkshire shares should be held until their scheduled distribution dates,\nthe \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d course for both my executors and trustees would be to sell the Berkshire shares under their temporary\ncontrol and reinvest the proceeds in U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities matching the scheduled dates for\ndistributions. That strategy would leave the fiduciaries immune from both public criticism and the possibility of\npersonal liability for failure to act in accordance with the \xe2\x80\x9cprudent man\xe2\x80\x9d standard.\n</p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>I myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during the\ndisposal period. There is always a chance \xe2\x80\x93 unlikely, but not negligible \xe2\x80\x93 that events will prove me wrong. I believe,\nhowever, that there is a high probability that my directive will deliver substantially greater resources to society than\nwould result from a conventional course of action.\n</p>\n<p>Key to my \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire-only\xe2\x80\x9d instructions is my faith in the future judgment and fidelity of Berkshire directors.\nThey will regularly be tested by Wall Streeters bearing fees. At many companies, these super-salesmen might win. I\ndo not, however, expect that to happen at Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>Boards of Directors\n</p>\n<p>In recent years, both the composition of corporate boards and their purpose have become hot topics. Once,\ndebate about the responsibilities of boards was largely limited to lawyers; today, institutional investors and politicians\nhave weighed in as well.\n</p>\n<p>My credentials for discussing corporate governance include the fact that, over the last 62 years, I have served\nas a director of 21 publicly-owned companies (listed below). In all but two of them, I have represented a substantial\nholding of stock. In a few cases, I have tried to implement important change.\n</p>\n<p>During the first 30 or so years of my services, it was rare to find a woman in the room unless she represented\na family controlling the enterprise. This year, it should be noted, marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment,\nwhich guaranteed American women the right to have their voices heard in a voting booth. Their attaining similar status\nin a board room remains a work in progress.\n</p>\n<p>Over the years, many new rules and guidelines pertaining to board composition and duties have come into\nbeing. The bedrock challenge for directors, nevertheless, remains constant: Find and retain a talented CEO \xe2\x80\x93\npossessing integrity, for sure \xe2\x80\x93 who will be devoted to the company for his/her business lifetime. Often, that task is\nhard. When directors get it right, though, they need to do little else. But when they mess it up, . . . . . .\n</p>\n<p>Audit committees now work much harder than they once did and almost always view the job with appropriate\nseriousness. Nevertheless, these committees remain no match for managers who wish to game numbers, an offense\nthat has been encouraged by the scourge of earnings \xe2\x80\x9cguidance\xe2\x80\x9d and the desire of CEOs to \xe2\x80\x9chit the number.\xe2\x80\x9d My direct\nexperience (limited, thankfully) with CEOs who have played with a company\xe2\x80\x99s numbers indicates that they were more\noften prompted by ego than by a desire for financial gain.\n</p>\n<p>Compensation committees now rely much more heavily on consultants than they used to. Consequently,\ncompensation arrangements have become more complicated \xe2\x80\x93 what committee member wants to explain paying large\nfees year after year for a simple plan? \xe2\x80\x93 and the reading of proxy material has become a mind-numbing experience.\n</p>\n<p>One very important improvement in corporate governance has been mandated: a regularly-scheduled\n\xe2\x80\x9cexecutive session\xe2\x80\x9d of directors at which the CEO is barred. Prior to that change, truly frank discussions of a CEO\xe2\x80\x99s\nskills, acquisition decisions and compensation were rare.\n</p>\n<p>Acquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members. The legal orchestration for\nmaking deals has been refined and expanded (a word aptly describing attendant costs as well). But I have yet to see a\nCEO who craves an acquisition bring in an informed and articulate critic to argue against it. And yes, include me\namong the guilty.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire, Blue Chip Stamps, Cap Cities-ABC, Coca-Cola, Data Documents, Dempster, General Growth, Gillette,\nKraft Heinz, Maracaibo Oil, Munsingwear, Omaha National Bank, Pinkerton\xe2\x80\x99s, Portland Gas Light, Salomon,\nSanborn Map, Tribune Oil, U.S. Air, Vornado, Washington Post, Wesco Financial\n</p>\n<p>12</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Overall, the deck is stacked in favor of the deal that\xe2\x80\x99s coveted by the CEO and his/her obliging staff. It would\nbe an interesting exercise for a company to hire two \xe2\x80\x9cexpert\xe2\x80\x9d acquisition advisors, one pro and one con, to deliver his\nor her views on a proposed deal to the board \xe2\x80\x93 with the winning advisor to receive, say, ten times a token sum paid to\nthe loser. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold your breath awaiting this reform: The current system, whatever its shortcomings for shareholders,\nworks magnificently for CEOs and the many advisors and other professionals who feast on deals. A venerable caution\nwill forever be true when advice from Wall Street is contemplated: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.\n</p>\n<p>Over the years, board \xe2\x80\x9cindependence\xe2\x80\x9d has become a new area of emphasis. One key point relating to this\ntopic, though, is almost invariably overlooked: Director compensation has now soared to a level that inevitably makes\npay a subconscious factor affecting the behavior of many non-wealthy members. Think, for a moment, of the director\nearning $250,000-300,000 for board meetings consuming a pleasant couple of days six or so times a year. Frequently,\nthe possession of one such directorship bestows on its holder three to four times the annual median income of U.S.\nhouseholds. (I missed much of this gravy train: As a director of Portland Gas Light in the early 1960s, I received $100\nannually for my service. To earn this princely sum, I commuted to Maine four times a year.)\n</p>\n<p>And job security now? It\xe2\x80\x99s fabulous. Board members may get politely ignored, but they seldom get fired.\nInstead, generous age limits \xe2\x80\x93 usually 70 or higher \xe2\x80\x93 act as the standard method for the genteel ejection of directors.\n</p>\n<p>Is it any wonder that a non-wealthy director (\xe2\x80\x9cNWD\xe2\x80\x9d) now hopes \xe2\x80\x93 or even yearns \xe2\x80\x93 to be asked to join a\nsecond board, thereby vaulting into the $500,000-600,000 class? To achieve this goal, the NWD will need help. The\nCEO of a company searching for board members will almost certainly check with the NWD\xe2\x80\x99s current CEO as to\nwhether NWD is a \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d director. \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, is a code word. If the NWD has seriously challenged his/her\npresent CEO\xe2\x80\x99s compensation or acquisition dreams, his or her candidacy will silently die. When seeking directors,\nCEOs don\xe2\x80\x99t look for pit bulls. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.\n</p>\n<p>Despite the illogic of it all, the director for whom fees are important \xe2\x80\x93 indeed, craved \xe2\x80\x93 is almost universally\nclassified as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d while many directors possessing fortunes very substantially linked to the welfare of the\ncorporation are deemed lacking in independence. Not long ago, I looked at the proxy material of a large American\ncompany and found that eight directors had never purchased a share of the company\xe2\x80\x99s stock using their own money.\n(They, of course, had received grants of stock as a supplement to their generous cash compensation.) This particular\ncompany had long been a laggard, but the directors were doing wonderfully.\n</p>\n<p>Paid-with-my-own-money ownership, of course, does not create wisdom or ensure business smarts.\nNevertheless, I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shares\nwith their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Here, a pause is due: I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to know that almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been\ndecent, likable and intelligent. They dressed well, made good neighbors and were fine citizens. I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed their\ncompany. Among the group are some men and women that I would not have met except for our mutual board service\nand who have become close friends.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money or\nbusiness matters. It simply was not their game.\n</p>\n<p>They, in turn, would never have asked me for help in removing a tooth, decorating their home or improving\ntheir golf swing. Moreover, if I were ever scheduled to appear on Dancing With the Stars, I would immediately seek\nrefuge in the Witness Protection Program. We are all duds at one thing or another. For most of us, the list is long. The\nimportant point to recognize is that if you are Bobby Fischer, you must play only chess for money.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, we will continue to look for business-savvy directors who are owner-oriented and arrive with\na strong specific interest in our company. Thought and principles, not robot-like \xe2\x80\x9cprocess,\xe2\x80\x9d will guide their actions.\nIn representing your interests, they will, of course, seek managers whose goals include delighting their customers,\ncherishing their associates and acting as good citizens of both their communities and our country.\n</p>\n<p>13</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Those objectives are not new. They were the goals of able CEOs sixty years ago and remain so. Who would\nhave it otherwise?\n</p>\n<p>Short Subjects\n</p>\n<p>In past reports, we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed both the sense and nonsense of stock repurchases. Our thinking, boiled down:\nBerkshire will buy back its stock only if a) Charlie and I believe that it is selling for less than it is worth and b) the\ncompany, upon completing the repurchase, is left with ample cash.\n</p>\n<p>Calculations of intrinsic value are far from precise. Consequently, neither of us feels any urgency to buy an\nestimated $1 of value for a very real 95 cents. In 2019, the Berkshire price/value equation was modestly favorable at\ntimes, and we spent $5 billion in repurchasing about 1% of the company.\n</p>\n<p>Over time, we want Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s share count to go down. If the price-to-value discount (as we estimate it)\nwidens, we will likely become more aggressive in purchasing shares. We will not, however, prop the stock at any\nlevel.\n</p>\n<p>Shareholders having at least $20 million in value of A or B shares and an inclination to sell shares to Berkshire\nmay wish to have their broker contact Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. We request that you phone Mark\nbetween 8:00-8:30 a.m. or 3:00-3:30 p.m. Central Time, calling only if you are ready to sell.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>In 2019, Berkshire sent $3.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury to pay its current income tax. The U.S. government\ncollected $243 billion from corporate income tax payments during the same period. From these statistics, you can take\npride that your company delivered 11\xe2\x81\x842% of the federal income taxes paid by all of corporate America.\n</p>\n<p>Fifty-five years ago, when Berkshire entered its current incarnation, the company paid nothing in federal\nincome tax. (For good reason, too: Over the previous decade, the struggling business had recorded a net loss.) Since\nthen, as Berkshire retained nearly all of its earnings, the beneficiaries of that policy became not only the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nshareholders but also the federal government. In most future years, we both hope and expect to send far larger sums\nto the Treasury.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>On pages A-2 \xe2\x80\x93 A-3, you will find details about our annual meeting, which will be held on May 2, 2020.\nYahoo, as usual, will be streaming the event worldwide.
