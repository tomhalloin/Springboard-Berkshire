Over the last 35 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share\nbook value has grown from $19 to $37,987, a rate of 24.0% compounded annually.*\n</p>\n<p>The numbers on the facing page show just how poor our 1999 record was.  We had the worst absolute\nperformance of my tenure and, compared to the S&amp;P, the worst relative performance as well.  Relative results are what\nconcern us: Over time, bad relative numbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results.\n</p>\n<p>Even Inspector Clouseau could find last year\xe2\x80\x99s guilty party: your Chairman.  My performance reminds me of\nthe quarterback whose report card showed four Fs and a D but who nonetheless had an understanding coach.  \xe2\x80\x9cSon,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe drawled, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re spending too much time on that one subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>My \xe2\x80\x9cone subject\xe2\x80\x9d is capital allocation, and my grade for 1999 most assuredly is a D.  What most hurt us during\nthe year was the inferior performance of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s equity portfolio \xe2\x80\x94 and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving\naside the small piece of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine.  Several of our largest investees badly\nlagged the market in 1999 because they\xe2\x80\x99ve had disappointing operating results.  We still like these businesses and are\ncontent to have major investments in them.  But their stumbles damaged our performance last year, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no sure\nthing that they will quickly regain their stride.\n</p>\n<p>The fallout from our weak results in 1999 was a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price.  In  1998,\nto go back a bit, the stock outperformed the business.  Last year the business did much better than the stock, a\ndivergence that has continued to the date of this letter.  Over time, of course, the performance of the stock must roughly\nmatch the performance of the business.\n</p>\n<p>Despite our poor showing last year, Charlie Munger, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect\nthat the gain in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value over the next decade will modestly exceed the gain from owning  the S&amp;P.\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that, of course.  But we are willing to back our conviction with our own money.  To repeat a fact\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard before, well over 99% of my net worth resides in Berkshire.  Neither my wife nor I have ever sold a share\nof Berkshire and \xe2\x80\x94 unless our checks stop clearing \xe2\x80\x94 we have no intention of doing so.\n</p>\n<p>Please note that I spoke of hoping to beat the S&amp;P \xe2\x80\x9cmodestly.\xe2\x80\x9d  For Berkshire, truly large superiorities over\nthat index are a thing of the past.  They existed then because we could buy both businesses and stocks at far more\nattractive prices than we can now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital base, a situation that allowed\nus to consider a much wider range of investment opportunities than are available to us today.\n</p>\n<p>Our optimism about Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s performance is also tempered by the expectation \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, in our minds,\nthe virtual certainty \xe2\x80\x94 that the S&amp;P will do far less well in the next decade or two than it has done since 1982.  A\nrecent article in Fortune expressed my views as to why this is inevitable, and I\xe2\x80\x99m enclosing a copy with this report.\n</p>\n<p>Our goal is to run our present businesses well \xe2\x80\x94 a task made easy  because of the outstanding managers we\nhave in place \xe2\x80\x94 and to acquire additional businesses having economic characteristics and managers comparable to\nthose we already own.  We made important progress in this respect during 1999 by acquiring Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s Furniture and\ncontracting to buy a major portion of MidAmerican Energy.  We will talk more about these companies later in the\nreport but let me emphasize one point here: We bought both for cash, issuing no Berkshire shares.  Deals of that kind\naren\xe2\x80\x99t always possible, but that is the method of acquisition that Charlie and I vastly prefer.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>4\n</p>\n<p>Guides to Intrinsic Value\n</p>\n<p>I often talk in these pages about intrinsic value, a key, though far from precise, measurement we utilize in our\nacquisitions of businesses and common stocks.  (For an extensive discussion of this, and other investment and\naccounting terms and concepts, please refer to our Owner\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on pages 55 - 62.  Intrinsic value is discussed on\npage 60.)\n</p>\n<p>In our last four reports, we have furnished you a table that we regard as useful in estimating Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nintrinsic value.  In the updated version of that table, which follows, we trace two key components of value.  The first\ncolumn lists our per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents but excluding assets held in our\nfinancial products operation) and the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s operating\nbusinesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments (discussed on page 61), but after all interest and corporate\nexpenses.  The second column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the investments\npresented in the first column.  In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would look if it were split into two parts, with\none entity holding our investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.\n</p>\n<p>Pre-tax Earnings\n           (Loss) Per Share\n</p>\n<p>Investments With All Income from\nYear Per Share Investments Excluded\n</p>\n<p>1969 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $      45 $      4.39    \n1979 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       577     13.07  \n1989 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    7,200 108.86\n1999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       47,339                   (458.55)\n</p>\n<p>Here are the growth rates of the two segments by decade:\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\n</p>\n<p>Investments With All Income from\nDecade Ending Per Share Investments Excluded\n</p>\n<p>1979 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     29.0% 11.5%\n1989 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     28.7% 23.6%\n1999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     20.7%     N.A.\n</p>\n<p>Annual Growth Rate, 1969-1999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     25.4%     N.A.\n</p>\n<p>In 1999, our per-share investments changed very little, but our operating earnings, affected by negatives that\noverwhelmed some strong positives, fell apart.  Most of our operating managers deserve a grade of A for delivering\nfine results and for having widened the difference between the intrinsic value of their businesses and the value at which\nthese are carried on our balance sheet.  But, offsetting this, we had a huge \xe2\x80\x94 and, I believe, aberrational \xe2\x80\x94\nunderwriting loss at General Re.  Additionally, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting profit fell, as we had predicted it would.\nGEICO\xe2\x80\x99s overall performance, though, was terrific, outstripping my ambitious goals.\n</p>\n<p>We do not expect our underwriting earnings to improve in any dramatic way this year.  Though GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s\nintrinsic value should grow by a highly satisfying amount, its underwriting performance is almost certain to weaken.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because auto insurers, as a group, will do worse in 2000, and because we will materially increase our marketing\nexpenditures.  At General Re, we are raising rates and, if there is no mega-catastrophe in 2000, the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderwriting loss should fall considerably.  It takes some time, however, for the full effect of rate increases to kick in,\nand General Re is therefore likely to have another unsatisfactory underwriting year.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>5\n</p>\n<p>You should be aware that one item regularly working to widen the amount by which intrinsic value exceeds book\nvalue is the annual charge against income we take for amortization of goodwill \xe2\x80\x94 an amount now running about $500\nmillion.  This charge reduces the amount of goodwill we show as an asset and likewise the amount that is included in\nour book value.  This is an accounting matter having nothing to do with true economic goodwill, which increases in most\nyears.  But even if economic goodwill were to remain constant, the annual amortization charge would persistently widen\nthe gap between intrinsic value and book value.\n</p>\n<p>Though we can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a precise figure for Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value, or even an approximation, Charlie and\nI can assure you that it far exceeds our $57.8 billion book value.  Businesses such as See\xe2\x80\x99s and Buffalo News are now\nworth fifteen to twenty times the value at which they are carried on our books.  Our goal is to continually widen this\nspread at all subsidiaries.\n</p>\n<p>A Managerial Story You Will Never Read Elsewhere\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s collection of managers is unusual in several important ways.  As one example, a very high percentage\nof these men and women are independently wealthy, having made fortunes in the businesses that they run.  They work\nneither because they need the money nor because they are contractually obligated to \xe2\x80\x94 we have no contracts at Berkshire.\nRather, they work long and hard because they love their businesses.  And I use the word \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\xe2\x80\x9d advisedly, since these\nmanagers are truly in charge \xe2\x80\x94 there are no show-and-tell presentations in Omaha, no budgets to be approved by\nheadquarters, no dictums issued about capital expenditures.  We simply ask our managers to run their companies as if\nthese are the sole asset of their families and will remain so for the next century.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I try to behave with our managers just as we attempt to behave with Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders, treating\nboth groups as we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.  Though \xe2\x80\x9cworking\xe2\x80\x9d means nothing to me\nfinancially, I love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me a sense of achievement, a freedom to act as\nI see fit and an opportunity to interact daily with people I like and trust.  Why should our managers \xe2\x80\x94  accomplished\nartists at what they do \xe2\x80\x94 see things differently?\n</p>\n<p>In their relations with Berkshire, our managers often appear to be hewing to President Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s charge, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk\nnot what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable story from last year:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s about R. C. Willey, Utah\xe2\x80\x99s dominant home furnishing business, which Berkshire purchased from Bill Child and his\nfamily in 1995.  Bill and most of his managers are Mormons, and for this reason R. C. Willey\xe2\x80\x99s stores have never\noperated on Sunday.  This is a difficult way to do business:  Sunday is the favorite shopping day for many customers.\nBill, nonetheless, stuck to his principles -- and while doing so built his business from $250,000 of annual sales in 1954,\nwhen he took over, to $342 million in 1999.\n</p>\n<p>Bill felt that R. C. Willey could operate successfully in markets outside of Utah and in 1997 suggested that we open\na store in Boise.  I was highly skeptical about taking a no-Sunday policy into a new territory where we would be up\nagainst entrenched rivals open seven days a week.  Nevertheless, this was Bill\xe2\x80\x99s business to run.  So,  despite my\nreservations, I told him to follow both his business judgment and his religious convictions.\n</p>\n<p>Bill then insisted on a truly extraordinary proposition: He would personally buy the land and build the store \xe2\x80\x94 for\nabout $9 million as it turned out \xe2\x80\x94 and would sell it to us at his cost if it proved to be successful.  On the other hand,\nif sales fell short of his expectations, we could exit the business without paying Bill a cent. This outcome, of course, would\nleave him with a huge investment in an empty building.  I told him that I appreciated his offer but felt that if Berkshire\nwas going to get the upside it should also take the downside.  Bill said nothing doing: If there was to be failure because\nof his religious beliefs, he wanted to take the blow personally.\n</p>\n<p>The store opened last August and immediately became a huge success.  Bill thereupon turned the property over\nto us \xe2\x80\x94 including some extra land that had appreciated significantly \xe2\x80\x94 and we wrote him a check for his cost.  And get\nthis:  Bill refused to take a dime of interest on the capital he had tied up over the two years.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>6\n</p>\n<p>If a manager has behaved similarly at some other public corporation, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about it.  You can understand\nwhy the opportunity to partner with people like Bill Child causes me to tap dance to work every morning.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>A footnote: After our \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d opening in August, we had a grand opening of the Boise store about a month later.\nNaturally, I went there to cut the ribbon (your Chairman, I wish to emphasize, is good for something).  In my talk I told\nthe crowd how sales had far exceeded expectations, making us, by a considerable margin, the largest home furnishings\nstore in Idaho.  Then, as the speech progressed, my memory miraculously began to improve.  By the end of my talk, it\nall had come back to me: Opening a store in Boise had been my idea.\n</p>\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Our main business \xe2\x80\x94 though we have others of great importance \xe2\x80\x94 is insurance.  To understand Berkshire,\ntherefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the\namount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these\nfactors.\n</p>\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are\nreceived before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests\nthe money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually\ndo not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which is the\ncost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would\notherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\n</p>\n<p>A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring\ntheir underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company\'s true cost of float.  Errors\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly\ninto earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can\ntypically do no more than accept what\'s presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name\nauditors have implicitly blessed.  In 1999 a number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery of\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cearnings\xe2\x80\x9d that investors had relied on earlier when making their buy and sell decisions.  At Berkshire, we strive to\nbe conservative and consistent in our reserving.  Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant surprise is always possible.\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s insurance\noperations since we entered the business 33 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional\nlines are included in the segment \xe2\x80\x9cOther Primary\xe2\x80\x9d).  For the table we have calculated our float \xe2\x80\x94 which we generate in\nlarge amounts relative to our premium volume \xe2\x80\x94 by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under\nreinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs,\nprepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.  (Got that?)\n</p>\n<p>Yearend Float (in $ millions)\n</p>\n<p>Year GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\nOther Other\n</p>\n<p>1967 20       20\n1977 40 131     171\n1987 701 807  1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014   455  7,386\n</p>\n<p>1998 3,125 14,909 4,305   415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285  403 25,298\n</p>\n<p>Growth of float is important \xe2\x80\x94 but its cost is what\xe2\x80\x99s vital.  Over the years we have usually recorded only a small\nunderwriting loss \xe2\x80\x94 which means our cost of float was correspondingly low \xe2\x80\x94 or actually had an underwriting profit,</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>7\n</p>\n<p>which means we were being paid for holding other people\xe2\x80\x99s money.  Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an\nunderwriting profit.  In 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting loss that left us with float cost of 5.8%.\nOne mildly mitigating factor: We enthusiastically welcomed $400 million of the loss because it stems from business that\nwill deliver us exceptional float over the next decade.  The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly unwelcome, and\nour overall result must be judged extremely poor.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000, but\nany decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO, which we will discuss later.\n</p>\n<p>There are a number of people who deserve credit for manufacturing so much \xe2\x80\x9cno-cost\xe2\x80\x9d float over the years.\nForemost is Ajit Jain.  It\xe2\x80\x99s simply impossible to overstate Ajit\xe2\x80\x99s value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built an\noutstanding reinsurance business, which during his tenure has earned an underwriting profit and now holds $6.3 billion\nof float.\n</p>\n<p>In Ajit, we have an underwriter equipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the realism to forget\nabout those he can\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate; the courage to write huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline to\nreject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate.  It is rare to find a person possessing any one of these\ntalents.  For one person to have them all is remarkable.\n</p>\n<p>Since Ajit specializes in super-cat reinsurance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely large when they\noccur, his business is sure to be far more volatile than most insurance operations.  To date, we have benefitted from good\nluck on this volatile book.  Even so, Ajit\xe2\x80\x99s achievements are truly extraordinary.\n</p>\n<p>In a smaller but nevertheless important way, our \xe2\x80\x9cother primary\xe2\x80\x9d insurance operation has also added to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nintrinsic value.  This collection of insurers has delivered a $192 million underwriting profit over the past five years while\nsupplying us with the float shown in the table.  In the insurance world, results like this are uncommon, and for their feat\nwe thank Rod Eldred, Brad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster.\n</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the General Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year in 1999 (though\ninvestment income left the company well in the black).  Our business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and\ninternationally, a condition that is improving but not yet corrected.  Over time, however, the company should develop\na growing amount of low-cost float.  At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive compensation plans are\nnow directly tied to the variables of float growth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value for owners.\n</p>\n<p>Even though a reinsurer may have a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot count on every\nyear coming up roses.  Reinsurance is a highly volatile business, and neither General Re nor Ajit\xe2\x80\x99s operation is immune\nto bad pricing behavior in the industry.  But General Re has the distribution , the underwriting skills, the culture, and\n\xe2\x80\x94 with Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s backing \xe2\x80\x94 the financial clout to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s most profitable reinsurance company.  Getting\nthere will take time, energy and discipline, but we have no doubt that Ron Ferguson and his crew can make it happen.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com)\n</p>\n<p>GEICO made exceptional progress in 1999.  The reasons are simple: We have a terrific business idea being\nimplemented by an extraordinary manager, Tony Nicely.  When Berkshire purchased GEICO at the beginning of 1996,\nwe handed the keys to Tony and asked him to run the operation exactly as if he owned 100% of it.  He has done the rest.\nTake a look at his scorecard:\n</p>\n<p>New Auto Auto Policies\nYears       Policies        In-Force(1)(2) (1)\n</p>\n<p>1993   346,882 2,011,055\n1994   384,217 2,147,549\n1995   443,539 2,310,037\n1996   592,300 2,543,699\n1997   868,430 2,949,439\n1998 1,249,875 3,562,644\n1999 1,648,095 4,328,900\n</p>\n<p> \xe2\x80\x9cVoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d only; excludes assigned risks and the like.(1) \n</p>\n<p> Revised to exclude policies moved from one GEICO company to another.(2)</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>8\n</p>\n<p>In 1995, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors.  Last year the company spent\n$242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631.  And we are just starting: The pace will step up materially in 2000.\nIndeed, we would happily commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew we could handle the business smoothly\nand if we expected the last dollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost.\n</p>\n<p>Currently two trends are affecting acquisition costs.  The bad news is that it has become more expensive to develop\ninquiries.  Media rates have risen, and we are also seeing diminishing returns \xe2\x80\x94 that is, as both we and our competitors\nstep up advertising, inquiries per ad fall for all of us.  These negatives are partly offset, however, by the fact that our\nclosure ratio \xe2\x80\x94 the percentage of inquiries converted to sales \xe2\x80\x94 has steadily improved.  Overall, we believe that our\ncost of new business, though definitely rising, is well below that of the industry.  Of even greater importance, our\noperating costs for renewal business are the lowest among broad-based national auto insurers.  Both of these major\ncompetitive advantages are sustainable.  Others may copy our model, but they will be unable to replicate our economics.\n</p>\n<p>The table above makes it appear that GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s retention of policyholders is falling, but for two reasons\nappearances are in this case deceiving.  First, in the last few years our business mix has moved away from \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred\xe2\x80\x9d\npolicyholders, for whom industrywide retention rates are high, toward \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-standard\xe2\x80\x9d policyholders for\nwhom retention rates are much lower.  (Despite the nomenclature, the three classes have similar profit prospects.)\nSecond, retention rates for relatively new policyholders are always lower than those for long-time customers \xe2\x80\x94 and\nbecause of our accelerated growth, our policyholder ranks now include an increased proportion of new customers.\nAdjusted for these two factors, our retention rate has changed hardly at all.\n</p>\n<p>We told you last year that underwriting margins for both GEICO and the industry would fall in 1999, and they\ndid.  We make a similar prediction for 2000.  A few years ago margins got too wide, having enjoyed the effects of an\nunusual and unexpected decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents.  The industry responded by reducing rates\n\xe2\x80\x94 but now is having to contend with an increase in loss costs.  We would not be surprised to see the margins of auto\ninsurers deteriorate by around three percentage points in 2000.\n</p>\n<p>Two negatives besides worsening frequency and severity will hurt the industry this year.  First, rate increases go\ninto effect only slowly, both because of regulatory delay and because insurance contracts must run their course before\nnew rates can be put in.  Second, reported earnings of many auto insurers have benefitted in the last few years from\nreserve releases, made possible because the companies overestimated their loss costs in still-earlier years.  This reservoir\nof redundant reserves has now largely dried up, and future boosts to earnings from this source will be minor at best. \n</p>\n<p>In compensating its associates \xe2\x80\x94 from Tony on down \xe2\x80\x94 GEICO continues to use two variables, and only two,\nin determining what bonuses and profit-sharing contributions will be: 1) its percentage growth in policyholders and 2)\nthe earnings of its \xe2\x80\x9cseasoned\xe2\x80\x9d business, meaning policies that have been with us for more than a year.  We did\noutstandingly well on both fronts during 1999 and therefore made a profit-sharing payment of 28.4% of salary (in total,\n$113.3 million) to the great majority of our associates.  Tony and I love writing those checks.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, we want to have compensation policies that are both easy to understand and in sync with what we\nwish our associates to accomplish.  Writing new business is expensive (and, as mentioned, getting more expensive).\nIf we were to include those costs in our calculation of bonuses \xe2\x80\x94 as managements did before our arrival at GEICO \xe2\x80\x94\nwe would be penalizing our associates for garnering new policies, even though these are very much in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\ninterest.  So, in effect, we say to our associates that we will foot the bill for new business.  Indeed, because percentage\ngrowth in policyholders is part of our compensation scheme, we reward our associates for producing this initially-\nunprofitable business.  And then we  reward them additionally for holding down costs on our seasoned business.\n</p>\n<p>Despite the extensive advertising we do, our best source of new business is word-of-mouth recommendations from\nexisting policyholders, who on the whole are pleased with our prices and service.  An article published last year by\nKiplinger\xe2\x80\x99s Personal Finance Magazine gives a good picture of where we stand in customer satisfaction: The\nmagazine\xe2\x80\x99s survey of 20 state insurance departments showed that GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s complaint ratio was well below the ratio\nfor most of its major competitors.\n</p>\n<p>Our strong referral business means that we probably could maintain our policy count by spending as little as $50\nmillion annually on advertising.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a guess, of course, and we will never know whether it is accurate because\nTony\xe2\x80\x99s foot is going to stay on the advertising pedal (and my foot will be on his).  Nevertheless, I want to emphasize\nthat a major percentage of the $300-$350 million we will spend in 2000 on advertising, as well as large additional costs</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>9\n</p>\n<p>we will incur for sales counselors, communications and facilities, are optional outlays we choose to make so that we\ncan both achieve significant growth and extend and solidify the promise of the GEICO brand in the minds of Americans.\n</p>\n<p>Personally, I think these expenditures are the best investment Berkshire can make.  Through its advertising,\nGEICO is acquiring a direct relationship with a huge number of households that, on average, will send us $1,100 year\nafter year.  That makes us \xe2\x80\x94 among all companies, selling whatever kind of product \xe2\x80\x94 one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading\ndirect merchandisers.  Also, as we build our long-term relationships with more and more families, cash is pouring in\nrather than going out (no Internet economics here).  Last year, as GEICO increased its customer base by 766,256, it\ngained $590 million of cash from operating earnings and the increase in float.\n</p>\n<p>In the past three years, we have increased our market share in personal auto insurance from 2.7% to 4.1%.  But\nwe rightfully belong in many more households \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even yours.  Give us a call and find out.  About 40% of those\npeople checking our rates find that they can save money by doing business with us.  The proportion is not 100% because\ninsurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some giving more credit than we do to drivers who live in certain\ngeographic areas or work at certain occupations.  Our closure rate indicates, however, that we more frequently offer the\nlow price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers.  Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer\na special discount \xe2\x80\x94 usually 8% \xe2\x80\x94 to our shareholders.  Just be sure to identify yourself as a Berkshire owner so that\nour sales counselor can make the appropriate adjustment.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s with sadness that I report to you that Lorimer Davidson, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s former Chairman, died last November,  a\nfew days after his 97  birthday.  For GEICO, Davy was a business giant who moved the company up to the big leagues.th\n</p>\n<p>For me, he was a friend, teacher and hero.  I have told you of his lifelong kindnesses to me in past reports.  Clearly, my\nlife would have developed far differently had he not been a part of it.  Tony, Lou Simpson and I visited Davy in August\nand marveled at his mental alertness \xe2\x80\x94 particularly in all matters regarding GEICO.  He was the company\xe2\x80\x99s number\none supporter right up to the end, and we will forever miss him.\n</p>\n<p>Aviation Services\n</p>\n<p>Our two aviation services companies \xe2\x80\x94 FlightSafety International (\xe2\x80\x9cFSI\xe2\x80\x9d) and Executive Jet Aviation (\xe2\x80\x9cEJA\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\xe2\x80\x94 are both runaway leaders in their field.  EJA, which sells and manages the fractional ownership of jet aircraft,\nthrough its NetJets\xc2\xae program, is larger than its next two competitors combined.  FSI trains pilots (as well as other\ntransportation professionals) and is five times or so the size of its nearest competitor.\n</p>\n<p>Another common characteristic of the companies is that they are still managed by their founding entrepreneurs.\nAl Ueltschi started FSI in 1951 with $10,000, and Rich Santulli invented the fractional-ownership industry in 1986.\nThese men are both remarkable managers who have no financial need to work but thrive on helping their companies\ngrow and excel.\n</p>\n<p>Though these two businesses have leadership positions that are similar, they differ in their economic\ncharacteristics.  FSI must lay out huge amounts of capital.  A single flight simulator can cost as much as $15 million\n\xe2\x80\x94 and we have 222.  Only one person at a time, furthermore, can be trained in a simulator, which means that the capital\ninvestment per dollar of revenue at FSI is exceptionally high.  Operating margins must therefore also be high, if we are\nto earn a reasonable return on capital.  Last year we made capital expenditures of $215 million at FSI and FlightSafety\nBoeing, its 50%-owned affiliate.\n</p>\n<p>At EJA, in contrast, the customer owns the equipment, though we, of course, must invest in a core fleet of our own\nplanes to ensure outstanding service.  For example, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, EJA\xe2\x80\x99s busiest day of the year, strains\nour resources since fractions of 169 planes are owned by 1,412 customers, many of whom are bent on flying home\nbetween 3 and 6 p.m.  On that day, and certain others, we need a supply of company-owned aircraft to make sure all\nparties get where they want, when they want.\n</p>\n<p>Still, most of the planes we fly are owned by customers, which means that modest pre-tax margins in this business\ncan produce good returns on equity.  Currently, our customers own planes worth over $2 billion, and in addition we have\n$4.2 billion of planes on order.  Indeed, the limiting factor in our business right now is the availability of planes.  We</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>10\n</p>\n<p>now are taking delivery of about 8% of all business jets manufactured in the world, and we wish we could get a bigger\nshare than that.  Though EJA was supply-constrained in 1999, its recurring revenues \xe2\x80\x94 monthly management fees plus\nhourly flight fees \xe2\x80\x94 increased 46%.\n</p>\n<p>The fractional-ownership industry is still in its infancy.  EJA is now building critical mass in Europe, and over\ntime we will expand around the world.  Doing that will be expensive \xe2\x80\x94 very expensive \xe2\x80\x94 but we will spend what it\ntakes.  Scale is vital to both us and our customers: The company with the most planes in the air worldwide will be able\nto offer its customers the best service.  \xe2\x80\x9cBuy a fraction, get a fleet\xe2\x80\x9d has real meaning at EJA.\n</p>\n<p>EJA enjoys another important advantage in that its two largest competitors are both subsidiaries of aircraft\nmanufacturers and sell only the aircraft their parents make.  Though these are fine planes, these competitors are severely\nlimited in the cabin styles and mission capabilities they can offer.  EJA, in contrast, offers a wide array of planes from\nfive suppliers.  Consequently, we can give the customer whatever he needs to buy \xe2\x80\x94 rather than his getting what the\ncompetitor\xe2\x80\x99s parent needs to sell.\n</p>\n<p>Last year in this report, I described my family\xe2\x80\x99s delight with the one-quarter (200 flight hours annually) of a\nHawker 1000 that we had owned since 1995.  I got so pumped up by my own prose that shortly thereafter I signed up\nfor one-sixteenth of a Cessna V Ultra as well.  Now my annual outlays at EJA and Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, combined, total ten times\nmy salary.  Think of this as a rough guideline for your own expenditures with us. \n</p>\n<p>During the past year, two of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s outside directors have also signed on with EJA.  (Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re paying\nthem too much.)  You should be aware that they and I are charged exactly the same price for planes and service as is\nany other customer: EJA follows a \xe2\x80\x9cmost favored nations\xe2\x80\x9d policy, with no one getting a special deal.\n</p>\n<p>And now, brace yourself.  Last year, EJA passed the ultimate test: Charlie signed up.  No other endorsement could\nspeak more eloquently to the value of the EJA service.  Give us a call at 1-800-848-6436 and ask for our \xe2\x80\x9cwhite paper\xe2\x80\x9d\non fractional ownership.\n</p>\n<p>Acquisitions of 1999\n</p>\n<p>At both GEICO and Executive Jet, our best source of new customers is the happy ones we already have.  Indeed,\nabout 65% of our new owners of aircraft come as referrals from current owners who have fallen in love with the service.\n</p>\n<p>Our acquisitions usually develop in the same way.  At other companies, executives may devote themselves to\npursuing acquisition possibilities with investment bankers, utilizing an auction process that has become standardized.\nIn this exercise the bankers prepare a \xe2\x80\x9cbook\xe2\x80\x9d that makes me think of the Superman comics of my youth.  In the Wall\nStreet version, a formerly mild-mannered company emerges from the investment banker\xe2\x80\x99s phone booth able to leap over\ncompetitors in a single bound and with earnings moving faster than a speeding bullet.  Titillated by the book\xe2\x80\x99s\ndescription of the acquiree\xe2\x80\x99s powers, acquisition-hungry CEOs \xe2\x80\x94 Lois Lanes all, beneath their cool exteriors \xe2\x80\x94\npromptly swoon.\n</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s particularly entertaining in these books is the precision with which earnings are projected for many years\nahead.  If you ask the author-banker, however, what his own firm will earn next month, he will go into a protective\ncrouch and tell you that business and markets are far too uncertain for him to venture a forecast.\n</p>\n<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s one story I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist relating: In 1985, a major investment banking house undertook to sell Scott Fetzer,\noffering it widely \xe2\x80\x94 but with no success.  Upon reading of this strikeout, I wrote Ralph Schey, then and now Scott\nFetzer\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, expressing an interest in buying the business.  I had never met Ralph, but within a week we had a deal.\nUnfortunately, Scott Fetzer\xe2\x80\x99s letter of engagement with the banking firm provided it a $2.5 million fee upon sale, even\nif it had nothing to do with finding the buyer.  I guess the lead banker felt he should do something for his payment, so\nhe graciously offered us a copy of the book on Scott Fetzer that his firm had prepared.  With his customary tact, Charlie\nresponded: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay $2.5 million not to read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, our carefully-crafted acquisition strategy is simply to wait for the phone to ring.  Happily, it\nsometimes does so, usually because a manager who sold to us earlier has recommended to a friend that he think about\nfollowing suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>11\n</p>\n<p>Which brings us to the furniture business.  Two years ago I recounted how the acquisition of Nebraska Furniture\nMart in 1983 and my subsequent association with the Blumkin family led to follow-on transactions with R. C. Willey\n(1995) and Star Furniture (1997).  For me, these relationships have all been terrific.  Not only did Berkshire acquire\nthree outstanding retailers; these deals also allowed me to become friends with some of the finest people you will ever\nmeet.\n</p>\n<p>Naturally, I have persistently asked the Blumkins, Bill Child and Melvyn Wolff whether there are any more out\nthere like you.  Their invariable answer was the Tatelman brothers of New England and their remarkable furniture\nbusiness, Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s.\n</p>\n<p>I met Barry and Eliot Tatelman last year and we soon signed an agreement for Berkshire to acquire the company.\nLike our three previous furniture acquisitions, this business had long been in the family \xe2\x80\x94 in this case since 1927, when\nBarry and Eliot\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather began operations in a Boston suburb.  Under the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 management, Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s has\ngrown ever more dominant in its region, becoming the largest furniture retailer in New Hampshire as well as\nMassachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>The Tatelmans don\xe2\x80\x99t just sell furniture or manage stores.  They also present customers with a dazzling\nentertainment experience called \xe2\x80\x9cshoppertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d  A family visiting a store can have a terrific time, while\nconcurrently viewing an extraordinary selection of merchandise.  The business results are also extraordinary: Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s\nhas the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture operation in the country.  I urge you to visit one of their\nstores if you are in the Boston area \xe2\x80\x94 particularly the one at Natick, which is Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s newest.  Bring money.\n</p>\n<p>Barry and Eliot are classy people \xe2\x80\x94 just like their counterparts at Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s three other furniture operations.\nWhen they sold to us, they elected to give each of their employees at least 50\xc2\xa2 for every hour that he or she had worked\nfor Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s.  This payment added up to $9 million, which came from the Tatelmans\xe2\x80\x99 own pockets, not from Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s.\nAnd Barry and Eliot were thrilled to write the checks.\n</p>\n<p>Each of our furniture operations is number one in its territory.  We now sell more furniture than anyone else in\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Texas, Nebraska, Utah and Idaho.  Last year Star\xe2\x80\x99s Melvyn Wolff and his sister, Shirley\nToomim, scored two major successes: a move into San Antonio and a significant enlargement of Star\xe2\x80\x99s store in Austin.\n</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no operation in the furniture retailing business remotely like the one assembled by Berkshire.  It\xe2\x80\x99s fun for\nme and profitable for you.  W. C. Fields once said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a woman who drove me to drink, but unfortunately I never\nhad the chance to thank her.\xe2\x80\x9d  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make that mistake.  My thanks go to Louie, Ron and Irv Blumkin for\ngetting me started in the furniture business and for unerringly guiding me as we have assembled the group we now have.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Now, for our second acquisition deal: It came to us through my good friend, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman of Level\n3 Communications and a director of Berkshire.  Walter has many other business connections as well, and one of them\nis with MidAmerican Energy, a utility company in which he has substantial holdings and on whose board he sits.  At\na conference in California that we both attended last September, Walter casually asked me whether Berkshire might be\ninterested in making a large investment in MidAmerican, and from the start the idea of being in partnership with Walter\nstruck me as a good one.  Upon returning to Omaha, I read some of MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s public reports and had two short\nmeetings with Walter and David Sokol, MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s talented and entrepreneurial CEO.  I then said that, at an\nappropriate price, we would indeed like to make a deal.\n</p>\n<p>Acquisitions in the electric utility industry are complicated by a variety of regulations including the Public Utility\nHolding Company Act of 1935.  Therefore, we had to structure a transaction that would avoid Berkshire gaining voting\ncontrol.  Instead we are purchasing an 11% fixed-income security, along with a combination of common stock and\nexchangeable preferred that will give Berkshire just under 10% of the voting power of MidAmerican but about 76% of\nthe equity interest.  All told, our investment will be about $2 billion.\n</p>\n<p>Walter characteristically backed up his convictions with real money: He and his family will buy more\nMidAmerican stock for cash when the transaction closes, bringing their total investment to about $280 million.  Walter\nwill also be the controlling shareholder of the company, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a better person to hold that post.\n</p>\n<p>Though there are many regulatory constraints in the utility industry, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that we will make additional\ncommitments in the field.  If we do, the amounts involved could be large.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>12\n</p>\n<p>Acquisition Accounting\n</p>\n<p>Once again, I would like to make some comments about accounting, in this case about its application to\nacquisitions.  This is currently a very contentious topic and, before the dust settles, Congress may even intervene (a truly\nterrible idea).\n</p>\n<p>When a company is acquired, generally accepted accounting principles (\xe2\x80\x9cGAAP\xe2\x80\x9d) currently condone two very\ndifferent ways of recording the transaction: \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpooling.\xe2\x80\x9d  In a pooling, stock must be the currency; in a\npurchase, payment can be made in either cash or stock.  Whatever the currency, managements usually detest purchase\naccounting because it almost always requires that a \xe2\x80\x9cgoodwill\xe2\x80\x9d account be established and subsequently written off \xe2\x80\x94\na process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge that normally persists for decades.  In contrast, pooling avoids\na goodwill account, which is why managements love it.\n</p>\n<p>Now, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\xe2\x80\x9cFASB\xe2\x80\x9d) has proposed an end to pooling, and many CEOs are\ngirding for battle.  It will be an important fight, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll venture some opinions.  To begin with, we agree with the many\nmanagers who argue that goodwill amortization charges are usually spurious.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll find my thinking about this in the\nappendix to our 1983 annual report, which is available on our website, and in the Owner\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on pages 55 - 62.\n</p>\n<p>For accounting rules to mandate amortization that will, in the usual case, conflict with reality is deeply\ntroublesome:  Most accounting charges relate to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t precisely measure it.  As an\nexample, depreciation charges can\xe2\x80\x99t with precision calibrate the decline in value that physical assets suffer, but these\ncharges do at least describe something that is truly occurring: Physical assets invariably deteriorate.  Correspondingly,\nobsolescence charges for  inventories, bad debt charges for receivables and accruals for warranties are among the charges\nthat reflect true costs.  The annual charges for these expenses can\xe2\x80\x99t be exactly measured, but the necessity for estimating\nthem is obvious.\n</p>\n<p>In contrast, economic goodwill does not, in many cases, diminish.  Indeed, in a great many instances \xe2\x80\x94  perhaps\nmost \xe2\x80\x94  it actually grows in value over time.  In character, economic goodwill is much like land: The value of both\nassets is sure to fluctuate, but the direction in which value is going to go is in no way ordained.  At See\xe2\x80\x99s, for example,\neconomic goodwill has grown, in an irregular but very substantial manner, for 78 years.  And, if we run the business\nright, growth of that kind will probably continue for at least another 78 years. \n</p>\n<p>To escape from the fiction of goodwill charges, managers embrace the fiction of pooling.  This accounting\nconvention is grounded in the poetic notion that when two rivers merge their streams become indistinguishable.  Under\nthis concept, a company that has been merged into a larger enterprise has not been \xe2\x80\x9cpurchased\xe2\x80\x9d (even though it will\noften have received a large \xe2\x80\x9csell-out\xe2\x80\x9d premium).  Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those pesky subsequent\ncharges to earnings are eliminated.  Instead, the accounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses had\nforever been one unit.\n</p>\n<p>So much for poetry.  The reality of merging is usually far different: There is indisputably an acquirer and an\nacquiree, and the latter has been \xe2\x80\x9cpurchased,\xe2\x80\x9d no matter how the deal has been structured.  If you think otherwise, just\nask employees severed from their jobs which company was the conqueror and which was the conquered.  You will find\nno confusion.  So on this point the FASB is correct: In most mergers, a purchase has been made.  Yes, there are some\ntrue \xe2\x80\x9cmergers of equals,\xe2\x80\x9d but they are few and far between.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a reality-based approach that should both satisfy the FASB, which correctly wishes\nto record a purchase, and meet the objections of managements to nonsensical charges for diminution of goodwill.  We\nwould first have the acquiring company record its purchase price \xe2\x80\x94 whether paid in stock or cash \xe2\x80\x94 at fair value.  In\nmost cases, this procedure would create a large asset representing economic goodwill.  We would then leave this asset\non the books, not requiring its amortization.  Later, if the economic goodwill became impaired, as it sometimes would,\nit would be written down just as would any other asset judged to be impaired.\n</p>\n<p>If our proposed rule were to be adopted, it should be applied retroactively so that acquisition accounting would\nbe consistent throughout America \xe2\x80\x94 a far cry from what exists today.  One prediction: If this plan were to take effect,\nmanagements would structure acquisitions more sensibly, deciding whether to use cash or stock based on the real\nconsequences for their shareholders rather than on the unreal consequences for their reported earnings.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>13\n</p>\n<p>In our purchase of Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s, we followed a procedure that will maximize the cash produced for our shareholders\nbut minimize the earnings we report to you.  Berkshire purchased assets for cash, an approach that on our tax returns\npermits us to amortize the resulting goodwill over a 15-year period.  Obviously, this tax deduction  materially increases\nthe amount of cash delivered by the business.  In contrast, when stock, rather than assets, is purchased for cash, the\nresulting writeoffs of goodwill are not tax-deductible.  The economic difference between these two approaches is\nsubstantial.\n</p>\n<p>From the economic standpoint of the acquiring company, the worst deal of all is a stock-for-stock acquisition.\nHere, a huge price is often paid without there being any step-up in the tax basis of either the stock of the acquiree or its\nassets.  If the acquired entity is subsequently sold, its owner may owe a large capital gains tax (at a 35% or greater rate),\neven though the sale may truly be producing a major economic loss.\n</p>\n<p>We have made some deals at Berkshire that used far-from-optimal tax structures.  These deals occurred because\nthe sellers insisted on a given structure and because, overall, we still felt the acquisition made sense.  We have never\ndone an inefficiently-structured deal, however, in order to make our figures look better.\n</p>\n<p>Sources of Reported Earnings\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire\'s reported earnings.  In this presentation, purchase-\naccounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and\nshown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been reported had\nwe not purchased them.  For the reasons discussed on page 61, this form of presentation seems to us to be more useful\nto investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-\npremiums to be charged off business-by-business.

The exception\nwas Dexter Shoe, and there the shortfall did not occur because of managerial problems: In skills, energy and devotion\nto their work, the Dexter executives are every bit the equal of our other managers.  But we manufacture shoes primarily\nin the U.S., and it has become extremely difficult for domestic producers to compete effectively.  In 1999, approximately\n93% of the 1.3 billion pairs of shoes purchased in this country came from abroad, where extremely low-cost labor is the\nrule.\n</p>\n<p>Counting both Dexter and H. H. Brown, we are currently the leading domestic manufacturer of shoes, and we are\nlikely to continue to be.  We have loyal, highly-skilled workers in our U.S. plants, and we want to retain every job here\nthat we can.  Nevertheless, in order to remain viable, we are sourcing more of our output internationally.  In doing that,\nwe have incurred significant severance and relocation costs that are included in the earnings we show in the table.\n</p>\n<p>A few years back, Helzberg\xe2\x80\x99s, our 200-store jewelry operation, needed to make operating adjustments to restore\nmargins to appropriate levels.  Under Jeff Comment\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, the job was done and profits have dramatically\nrebounded.  In the shoe business, where we have Harold Alfond, Peter Lunder, Frank Rooney and Jim Issler in charge,\nI believe we will see a similar improvement over the next few years.\n</p>\n<p>See\xe2\x80\x99s Candies deserves a special comment, given that it achieved a record operating margin of 24% last year.\nSince we bought See\xe2\x80\x99s for $25 million in 1972, it has earned $857 million pre-tax.  And, despite its growth, the business\nhas required very little additional capital.  Give the credit for this performance to Chuck Huggins.  Charlie and I put\nhim in charge the day of our purchase, and his fanatical insistence on both product quality and friendly service has\nrewarded customers, employees and owners.\n</p>\n<p>Chuck gets better every year.  When he took charge of See\xe2\x80\x99s at age 46, the company\xe2\x80\x99s pre-tax profit, expressed\nin millions, was about 10% of his age.  Today he\xe2\x80\x99s 74, and the ratio has increased to 100%.  Having discovered this\nmathematical relationship \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s call it Huggins\xe2\x80\x99 Law \xe2\x80\x94 Charlie and I now become giddy at the mere thought of\nChuck\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Additional information about our various businesses is given on pages 39 - 54, where you will also find our\nsegment earnings reported on a GAAP basis.  In addition, on pages 63 - 69, we have rearranged Berkshire\'s financial\ndata into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about the\ncompany.\n</p>\n<p>Look-Through Earnings\n</p>\n<p>Reported earnings are an inadequate measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers\nshown in the table presented earlier include only the dividends we receive from investees \xe2\x80\x94 though these dividends\ntypically represent only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership.  Not that we mind this division\nof money, since on balance we regard the undistributed earnings of investees as more valuable to us than the portion\npaid out.  The reason for our thinking is simple:  Our investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high\nrates of return.  So why should we want them paid out?\n</p>\n<p>To depict something closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept\nof "look-through" earnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous\nsection, plus; (2) our share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not\nreflected in our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of\ninvestees had instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating "operating earnings" here, we exclude purchase-\naccounting adjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\n</p>\n<p>The following table sets forth our 1999 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can be no more\nthan approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.  (The dividends paid to us by these investees have\nbeen included in the operating earnings itemized on page 13, mostly under "Insurance Group:  Net Investment Income.")</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>15\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\'s Approximate Berkshire\'s Share of Undistributed\nBerkshire\'s Major Investees  Ownership at Yearend  Operating Earnings (in millions)(1)     (2)\n</p>\n<p>American Express Company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.3% $228\nThe Coca-Cola Company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    8.1%   144\nFreddie Mac . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   8.6%   127\nThe Gillette Company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   9.0%     53\nM&amp;T Bank . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   6.5%     17\nThe Washington Post Company . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.3%     30 \nWells Fargo &amp; Company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   3.6%   108  \n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\'s share of undistributed earnings of major investees 707  \nHypothetical tax on these undistributed investee earnings (99)  (3)  \n</p>\n<p>Reported operating earnings of Berkshire     1,318  \n      Total look-through earnings of Berkshire $ 1,926  \n</p>\n<p>     (1) Does not include shares allocable to minority interests\n     (2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n     (3) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays on the dividends it receives\n</p>\n<p>Investments\n</p>\n<p>Below we present our common stock investments.

As I mentioned earlier, several of the companies in which we have large\ninvestments had disappointing business results last year.  Nevertheless, we believe these companies have important\ncompetitive advantages that will endure over time.  This attribute, which makes for good long-term investment results,\nis one Charlie and I occasionally believe we can identify.  More often, however, we can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 not at least with a high\ndegree of conviction.  This explains, by the way, why we don\xe2\x80\x99t own stocks of tech companies, even though we share the\ngeneral view that our society will be transformed by their products and services.  Our problem \xe2\x80\x94 which we can\xe2\x80\x99t solve\nby studying up \xe2\x80\x94 is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech field possess a truly durable competitive\nadvantage.\n</p>\n<p>Our lack of tech insights, we should add, does not distress us.  After all, there are a great many business areas in\nwhich Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation expertise.  For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it\ncomes to evaluating patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects.  So we simply don\xe2\x80\x99t get into judgments\nin those fields.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>16\n</p>\n<p>If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence and when\nwe are approaching the perimeter.  Predicting the long-term economics of companies that operate in fast-changing\nindustries is simply far beyond our perimeter.  If others claim predictive skill in those industries \xe2\x80\x94 and seem to have\ntheir claims validated by the behavior of the stock market \xe2\x80\x94 we neither envy nor emulate them.  Instead, we just stick\nwith what we understand.  If we stray, we will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless and substituted\nhope for rationality.  Fortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost certain there will be opportunities from time to time for Berkshire to do\nwell within the circle we\xe2\x80\x99ve staked out.\n</p>\n<p>Right now, the prices of the fine businesses we already own are just not that attractive.  In other words, we feel\nmuch better about the businesses than their stocks.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why we haven\xe2\x80\x99t added to our present holdings.  Nevertheless,\nwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet scaled back our portfolio in a major way:  If the choice is between a questionable business at a\ncomfortable price or a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer the latter.  What really gets our\nattention, however, is a comfortable business at a comfortable price.\n</p>\n<p>Our reservations about the prices of securities we own apply also to the general level of equity prices.  We have\nnever attempted to forecast what the stock market is going to do in the next month or the next year, and we are not\ntrying to do that now.  But, as I point out in the enclosed article, equity investors currently seem wildly optimistic in\ntheir expectations about future returns.\n</p>\n<p>We see the growth in corporate profits as being largely tied to the business done in the country (GDP), and we see\nGDP growing at a real rate of about 3%.  In addition, we have hypothesized 2% inflation.  Charlie and I have no\nparticular conviction about the accuracy of 2%.  However, it\xe2\x80\x99s the market\xe2\x80\x99s view:  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n(TIPS) yield about two percentage points less than the standard treasury bond, and if you believe inflation rates are going\nto be higher than that, you can profit by simply buying TIPS and shorting Governments.\n</p>\n<p>If profits do indeed grow along with GDP, at about a 5% rate, the valuation placed on American business is\nunlikely to climb by much more than that.  Add in something for dividends, and you emerge with returns from equities\nthat are dramatically less than most investors have either experienced in the past or expect in the future.  If investor\nexpectations become more realistic \xe2\x80\x94 and they almost certainly will \xe2\x80\x94 the market adjustment is apt to be severe,\nparticularly in sectors in which speculation has been concentrated.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire will someday have opportunities to deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets \xe2\x80\x94 we are confident\nof that.  But, as the song goes, \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows where or when?\xe2\x80\x9d  Meanwhile, if anyone starts explaining to you what is\ngoing on in the truly-manic portions of this \xe2\x80\x9cenchanted\xe2\x80\x9d market, you might remember still another line of song: \xe2\x80\x9cFools\ngive you reasons, wise men never try.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Share Repurchases\n</p>\n<p>Recently, a number of shareholders have suggested to us that Berkshire repurchase its shares.  Usually the requests\nwere rationally based, but a few leaned on spurious logic.\n</p>\n<p>There is only one combination of facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: First, the\ncompany has available funds \xe2\x80\x94 cash plus sensible borrowing capacity \xe2\x80\x94 beyond the near-term needs of the business\nand, second, finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, conservatively-calculated.  To this we add\na caveat: Shareholders should have been supplied all the information they need for estimating that value.  Otherwise,\ninsiders could take advantage of their uninformed partners and buy out their interests at a fraction of true worth.  We\nhave, on rare occasions, seen that happen.  Usually, of course, chicanery is employed to drive stock prices up, not down.\n</p>\n<p>The business \xe2\x80\x9cneeds\xe2\x80\x9d that I speak of are of two kinds: First, expenditures that a company must make to maintain\nits competitive position (e.g., the remodeling of stores at Helzberg\xe2\x80\x99s) and, second, optional outlays, aimed at business\ngrowth, that management expects will produce more than a dollar of value for each dollar spent (R. C. Willey\xe2\x80\x99s\nexpansion into Idaho).\n</p>\n<p>When available funds exceed needs of those kinds, a company with a growth-oriented shareholder population can\nbuy new businesses or repurchase shares.  If a company\xe2\x80\x99s stock is selling well below intrinsic value, repurchases usually\nmake the most sense.  In the mid-1970s, the wisdom of making these was virtually screaming at managements, but few\nresponded.  In most cases, those that did made their owners much wealthier than if alternative courses of action had been</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>17\n</p>\n<p>pursued.  Indeed, during the 1970s (and, spasmodically, for some years thereafter) we searched for companies that were\nlarge repurchasers of their shares.  This often was a tipoff that the company was both undervalued and run by a\nshareholder-oriented management.\n</p>\n<p>That day is past.  Now, repurchases are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, in our view,\nignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price.  The shareholder who chooses to sell today, of course, is benefitted\nby any buyer, whatever his origin or motives.  But the continuing shareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic\nvalue.  Buying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick around.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I admit that we feel confident in estimating intrinsic value for only a portion of traded equities and\nthen only when we employ a range of values, rather than some pseudo-precise figure.  Nevertheless, it appears to us that\nmany companies now making repurchases are overpaying departing shareholders at the expense of those who stay.  In\ndefense of those companies, I would say that it is natural for CEOs to be optimistic about their own businesses.  They\nalso know a whole lot more about them than I do.  However, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel that too often today\xe2\x80\x99s repurchases are\ndictated by management\xe2\x80\x99s desire to \xe2\x80\x9cshow confidence\xe2\x80\x9d or be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-share\nvalue.\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes, too, companies say they are repurchasing shares to offset the shares issued when stock options granted\nat much lower prices are exercised.  This \xe2\x80\x9cbuy high, sell low\xe2\x80\x9d strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed\n\xe2\x80\x94 but never intentionally!  Managements, however, seem to follow this perverse activity very cheerfully.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, both option grants and repurchases may make sense \xe2\x80\x94 but if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because the two\nactivities are logically related.  Rationally, a company\xe2\x80\x99s decision to repurchase shares or to issue them should stand on\nits own feet.  Just because stock has been issued to satisfy options \xe2\x80\x94 or for any other reason \xe2\x80\x94 does not mean that stock\nshould be repurchased at a price above intrinsic value.  Correspondingly, a stock that sells well below intrinsic value\nshould be repurchased whether or not stock has previously been issued (or may be because of outstanding options).\n</p>\n<p>You should be aware that, at certain times in the past, I have erred in not making repurchases.  My appraisal of\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s value was then too conservative or I was too enthused about some alternative use of funds.  We have\ntherefore missed some opportunities \xe2\x80\x94 though Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s trading volume at these points was too light for us to have\ndone much buying, which means that the gain in our per-share value would have been minimal.  (A repurchase of, say,\n2% of a company\xe2\x80\x99s shares at a 25% discount from per-share intrinsic value produces only a \xc2\xbd% gain in that value at\nmost \xe2\x80\x94 and even less if the funds could alternatively have been deployed in value-building moves.)\n</p>\n<p>Some of the letters we\xe2\x80\x99ve received clearly imply that the writer is unconcerned about intrinsic value considerations\nbut instead wants us to trumpet an intention to repurchase so that the stock will rise (or quit going down).  If the writer\nwants to sell tomorrow, his thinking makes sense \xe2\x80\x94 for him! \xe2\x80\x94 but if he intends to hold, he should instead hope the\nstock falls and trades in enough volume for us to buy a lot of it.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way a repurchase program can have\nany real benefit for a continuing shareholder.\n</p>\n<p>We will not repurchase shares unless we believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value,\nconservatively calculated.  Nor will we attempt to talk the stock up or down.  (Neither publicly or privately have I ever\ntold anyone to buy or sell Berkshire shares.)  Instead we will give all shareholders \xe2\x80\x94 and potential shareholders \xe2\x80\x94 the\nsame valuation-related information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed.\n</p>\n<p>Recently, when the A shares fell below $45,000, we considered making repurchases.  We decided, however, to\ndelay buying, if indeed we elect to do any, until shareholders have had the chance to review this report.  If we do find\nthat repurchases make sense, we will only rarely place bids on the New York Stock Exchange (\xe2\x80\x9cNYSE\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, we\nwill respond to offers made directly to us at or below the NYSE bid.  If you wish to offer stock, have your broker call\nMark Millard at 402-346-1400.  When a trade occurs, the broker can either record it in the \xe2\x80\x9cthird market\xe2\x80\x9d or on the\nNYSE.  We will favor purchase of the B shares if they are selling at more than a 2% discount to the A.  We will not\nengage in transactions involving fewer than 10 shares of A or 50 shares of B.\n</p>\n<p>Please be clear about one point: We will never make purchases with the intention of stemming a decline in\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s price.  Rather we will make them if and when we believe that they represent an attractive use of the\nCompany\xe2\x80\x99s money.  At best, repurchases are likely to have only a very minor effect on the future rate of gain in our\nstock\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>18\n</p>\n<p>Shareholder-Designated Contributions\n</p>\n<p>About 97.3% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire\'s 1999 shareholder-designated contributions program,\nwith contributions totaling $17.2 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 70 - 71.\n</p>\n<p>Cumulatively, over the 19 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $147 million pursuant to the\ninstructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire\'s giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the\nphilanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves take on the\nresponsibility for their personal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $13.8 million in 1999,\nincluding in-kind donations of $2.5 million.\n</p>\n<p>To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.

Therefore, we are relocating to the Civic Auditorium (which is on Capitol Avenue between 18  and 19 ,th  th\n</p>\n<p>behind the Doubletree Hotel), the only other facility in Omaha offering the space we require.\n</p>\n<p>The Civic, however, is located in downtown Omaha, and we would create a parking and traffic nightmare if we\nwere to meet there on a weekday.  We will, therefore, convene on Saturday, April 29, with the doors opening at 7 a.m.,\nthe movie beginning at 8:30 and the meeting itself commencing at 9:30.  As in the past, we will run until 3:30 with a\nshort break at noon for food, which will be available at the Civic\xe2\x80\x99s concession stands.\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential\nyou will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again\nsigned up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal fashion, we will run buses from\nthe larger hotels to the meeting.  After the meeting, the buses will make trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska\nFurniture Mart, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.\n</p>\n<p>We have scheduled the meeting in 2002 and 2003 on the customary first Saturday in May.  In 2001, however, the\nCivic is already booked on that Saturday, so we will meet on April 28.  The Civic should fit our needs well on any\nweekend, since there will then be more than ample parking in nearby lots and garages as well as on streets.  We will\nalso be able to greatly enlarge the space we give exhibitors.  So, overcoming my normal commercial reticence, I will\nsee that you have a wide display of Berkshire products at the Civic that you can purchase.  As a benchmark, in 1999\nshareholders bought 3,059 pounds of See\xe2\x80\x99s candy, $16,155 of World Book Products, 1,928 pairs of Dexter shoes, 895\nsets of Quikut knives, 1,752 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo and 3,446 items of Berkshire apparel.  I know\nyou can do better.\n</p>\n<p>Last year, we also initiated the sale of at least eight fractions of Executive Jet aircraft.  We will again have an array\nof models at the Omaha airport for your inspection on Saturday and Sunday.  Ask an EJA representative at the Civic\nabout viewing any of these planes.\n</p>\n<p>Dairy Queen will also be on hand at the Civic and again will donate all proceeds to the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Miracle\nNetwork.  Last  year we sold 4,586 Dilly\xc2\xae bars, fudge bars and vanilla/orange bars.  Additionally, GEICO will have\na booth that will be staffed by a number of our top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you\nwith auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s discount.  Bring the\ndetails of your existing insurance, and check out whether we can save you some money.\n</p>\n<p>Finally, Ajit Jain and his associates will be on hand to offer both no-commission annuities and a liability policy\nwith jumbo limits of a size rarely available elsewhere.  Talk to Ajit and learn how to protect yourself and your family\nagainst a $10 million judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>19\n</p>\n<p>NFM\xe2\x80\x99s newly remodeled complex, located on a 75-acre site on 72  Street between Dodge and Pacific, is open fromnd\n</p>\n<p>10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  This operation offers an unrivaled\nbreadth of merchandise \xe2\x80\x94 furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets and computers \xe2\x80\x94 all at can\xe2\x80\x99t-be-beat prices.  In\n1999 NFM did more than $300 million of business at its 72  Street location, which in a metropolitan area of 675,000nd\n</p>\n<p>is an absolute miracle.  During the Thursday, April 27 to Monday, May 1 period, any shareholder presenting his or her\nmeeting credential will receive a discount that is customarily given only to employees.  We have offered this break to\nshareholders the last couple of years, and sales have been amazing.  In last year\xe2\x80\x99s five-day \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend,\xe2\x80\x9d NFM\xe2\x80\x99s\nvolume was $7.98 million, an increase of 26% from 1998 and 51% from 1997.\n</p>\n<p>Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s Manhattan store \xe2\x80\x94 will have two\nshareholder-only events.  The first will be a champagne and dessert party from 6 p.m.-10 p.m. on Friday, April 28.  The\nsecond, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, April 30.  On that day, Charlie and I will be on hand\nto sign sales tickets.  Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the largest\ncrowds, which will form on Friday evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On\nSaturday, we will be open until 7 p.m.  Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points\nbelow that of its major rivals, so be prepared to be blown away by both our prices and selection.\n</p>\n<p>In the mall outside of Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, we will again have Bob Hamman \xe2\x80\x94 the best bridge player the game has ever\nseen \xe2\x80\x94 available to play with our shareholders on Sunday.  We will also have a few other experts playing at additional\ntables.  In 1999, we had more demand than tables, but we will cure that problem this year.\n</p>\n<p>Patrick Wolff, twice US chess champion, will again be in the mall playing blindfolded against all comers.  He tells\nme that he has never tried to play more than four games simultaneously while handicapped this way but might try to\nbump that limit to five or six this year.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re a chess fan, take Patrick on \xe2\x80\x94 but be sure to check his blindfold before\nyour first move.\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 my favorite steakhouse \xe2\x80\x94 will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, April\n30, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until about midnight.  Please remember that you can\xe2\x80\x99t come to Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on Sunday\nwithout a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 3 (but not before).  If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s\non one of the other evenings you will be in town.  I make a \xe2\x80\x9cquality check\xe2\x80\x9d of Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s about once a week and can report\nthat their rare T-bone (with a double order of hash browns) is still unequaled throughout the country.\n</p>\n<p>The usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the Omaha\nGolden Spikes will play the Iowa Cubs.  Come early, because that\xe2\x80\x99s when the real action takes place.  Those who\nattended last year saw your Chairman pitch to Ernie Banks.\n</p>\n<p>This encounter proved to be the titanic duel that the sports world had long awaited.  After the first few pitches \xe2\x80\x94\nwhich were not my best, but when have I ever thrown my best? \xe2\x80\x94 I fired a brushback at Ernie just to let him know who\nwas in command.  Ernie charged the mound, and I charged the plate.  But a clash was avoided because we became\nexhausted before reaching each other.\n</p>\n<p>Ernie was dissatisfied with his performance last year and has been studying the game films all winter.  As you may\nknow, Ernie had 512 home runs in his career as a Cub.  Now that he has spotted telltale weaknesses in my delivery, he\nexpects to get #513 on April 29.  I, however, have learned new ways to disguise my \xe2\x80\x9cflutterball.\xe2\x80\x9d  Come and watch this\nmatchup.\n</p>\n<p>I should add that I have extracted a promise from Ernie that he will not hit a \xe2\x80\x9ccome-backer\xe2\x80\x9d at me since I would\nnever be able to duck in time to avoid it.  My reflexes are like Woody Allen\xe2\x80\x99s, who said his were so slow that he was\nonce hit by a car being pushed by two guys.\n</p>\n<p>Our proxy statement contains instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of other\ninformation that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.
