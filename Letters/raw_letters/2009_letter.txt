In this table, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\n</p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n</p>\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n</p>\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2009 was $21.8 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both\nour Class A and Class B stock by 19.8%. Over the last 45 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $84,487, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s recent acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has added at least 65,000\nshareholders to the 500,000 or so already on our books. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to Charlie Munger, my long-time partner,\nand me that all of our owners understand Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s operations, goals, limitations and culture. In each annual\nreport, consequently, we restate the economic principles that guide us. This year these principles appear on pages\n89-94 and I urge all of you \xe2\x80\x93 but particularly our new shareholders \xe2\x80\x93 to read them. Berkshire has adhered to these\nprinciples for decades and will continue to do so long after I\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\n</p>\n<p>In this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business, hoping to provide both a freshman\norientation session for our BNSF newcomers and a refresher course for Berkshire veterans.\n</p>\n<p>How We Measure Ourselves\n</p>\n<p>Our metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start,\nCharlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have \xe2\x80\x93 or have\nnot \xe2\x80\x93 accomplished. That keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then\npainting the bull\xe2\x80\x99s eye around it.\n</p>\n<p>Selecting the S&amp;P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can\nmatch its performance by holding an index fund. Why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result?\n</p>\n<p>A more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&amp;P. There are\ngood arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that is\nthe best test. But year-to-year market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. Even evaluations covering as long as a\ndecade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurement\nperiod. Steve Ballmer, of Microsoft, and Jeff Immelt, of GE, can tell you about that problem, suffering as they do\nfrom the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton.\n</p>\n<p>The ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s per-share intrinsic\nvalue. Alas, that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision, so we instead use a crude proxy for\nit: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93.\nAdditionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case at\nBerkshire. In aggregate, our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried on\nour books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and I\nbelieve that our book value \xe2\x80\x93 understated though it is \xe2\x80\x93 supplies the most useful tracking device for changes in\nintrinsic value. By this measurement, as the opening paragraph of this letter states, our book value since the start\nof fiscal 1965 has grown at a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.\n</p>\n<p>*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500th of those shown for A.\n</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s results would\nlook better, showing a gain since the start of fiscal 1965 of 22% compounded annually. Surprisingly, this modest\ndifference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year period\ncompared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965\nBerkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereas\ntoday Berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its first-class businesses.\n</p>\n<p>Summed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First,\nwe have never had any five-year period beginning with 1965-69 and ending with 2005-09 \xe2\x80\x93 and there have been\n41 of these \xe2\x80\x93 during which our gain in book value did not exceed the S&amp;P\xe2\x80\x99s gain. Second, though we have lagged\nthe S&amp;P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&amp;P in the\neleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than our\noffense, and that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to continue.\n</p>\n<p>The big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown, an\nunpleasant trend that is certain to continue. To be sure, Berkshire has many outstanding businesses and a cadre of\ntruly great managers, operating within an unusual corporate culture that lets them maximize their talents. Charlie\nand I believe these factors will continue to produce better-than-average results over time. But huge sums forge\ntheir own anchor and our future advantage, if any, will be a small fraction of our historical edge.\n</p>\n<p>What We Don\xe2\x80\x99t Do\n</p>\n<p>Long ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want to know is where I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nnever go there.\xe2\x80\x9d That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvert, always invert\xe2\x80\x9d as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approach\nworks on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and\nwife.)\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of how we apply Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s thinking at Berkshire:\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate, no matter how exciting their\nproducts may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth\nthat awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950). But\nthe future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the\ncompanies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding.\n</p>\n<p>Just because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean\nwe can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battle\nfor supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to\ncome seems reasonably predictable. Even then, we will make plenty of mistakes.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback\nposition at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cash\nwe may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be\nconstantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses.\n</p>\n<p>When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier\nof liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured\n$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government for\nhelp. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secure\nAmerican businesses that needed \xe2\x80\x93 without delay \xe2\x80\x93 our tangible vote of confidence. The remaining\n$6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that was\ncompleted without pause while, elsewhere, panic reigned.\n</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash-\nequivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. But we sleep well.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising and\nmonitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting management\nproblems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlie\nand I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use the\nindependence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner-\noriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rather\nsuffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come from\ndecisions made too slowly \xe2\x80\x93 or not at all \xe2\x80\x93 because of a stifling bureaucracy.\n</p>\n<p>With our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds of\ndifferent operating units. We hope to have many more of each. But we will never allow Berkshire\nto become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiple\nlayers of management. Instead, we plan to operate as a collection of separately-managed medium-\nsized and large businesses, most of whose decision-making occurs at the operating level. Charlie\nand I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers and\nsetting their compensation.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 We make no attempt to woo Wall Street. Investors who buy and sell based upon media or analyst\ncommentary are not for us. Instead we want partners who join us at Berkshire because they wish\nto make a long-term investment in a business they themselves understand and because it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\nfollows policies with which they concur. If Charlie and I were to go into a small venture with a\nfew partners, we would seek individuals in sync with us, knowing that common goals and a shared\ndestiny make for a happy business \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d between owners and managers. Scaling up to giant\nsize doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change that truth.\n</p>\n<p>To build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directly\nand informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions were\nreversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on the\nInternet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during a\nnon-trading period to digest just what has happened at our multi-faceted enterprise. (Occasionally,\nSEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be adequately\nsummarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline that\njournalists sometimes seek.\n</p>\n<p>Last year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830\nwords in the annual letter was this sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are certain, for example, that the economy will\nbe in shambles throughout 2009 \xe2\x80\x93 and probably well beyond \xe2\x80\x93 but that conclusion does not tell us\nwhether the market will rise or fall.\xe2\x80\x9d Many news organizations reported \xe2\x80\x93 indeed, blared \xe2\x80\x93 the first\npart of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terrible\njournalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I were\nforecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but also\nelsewhere, made it clear we weren\xe2\x80\x99t predicting the market at all. Any investors who were misled\nby the sensationalists paid a big price: The Dow closed the day of the letter at 7,063 and finished\nthe year at 10,428.\n</p>\n<p>Given a few experiences we\xe2\x80\x99ve had like that, you can understand why I prefer that our\ncommunications with you remain as direct and unabridged as possible.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move to the specifics of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s operations. We have four major operating sectors, each\ndiffering from the others in balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together,\nas is standard in financial statements, impedes analysis. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which\nis how Charlie and I view them.\n</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Our property-casualty (P/C) insurance business has been the engine behind Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s growth and will\ncontinue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion more\nthan their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our \xe2\x80\x9cGoodwill\xe2\x80\x9d account. These companies, however, are\nworth far more than their carrying value \xe2\x80\x93 and the following look at the economic model of the P/C industry will\ntell you why.\n</p>\n<p>Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from\ncertain workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model\nleaves us holding large sums \xe2\x80\x93 money we call \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to\ninvest this float for Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float\nwe hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does\nour float.\n</p>\n<p>If premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that\nadds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of free\nmoney \xe2\x80\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition,\nso vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in some\ncatastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use of\nfloat.\n</p>\n<p>In my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will\nabsolutely state that we have the best managers. Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we entered\nthe business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for\nseven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most \xe2\x80\x93 though\ncertainly not all \xe2\x80\x93 future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billion\nwith us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest.\n</p>\n<p>Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not a result to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\nindustry\xe2\x80\x99s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&amp;P\n500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running some\nunusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars to\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s value. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure for me to tell you about these all-stars.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising\nbudget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by Tony\nNicely, who joined the company at 18. Now 66, Tony still tap-dances to the office every day, just as I do at 79.\nWe both feel lucky to work at a business we love.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here\xe2\x80\x99s proof: Since Berkshire\nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the net\naddition of seven million policyholders. Perhaps they contacted us because they thought our gecko was cute, but\nthey bought from us to save important money. (Maybe you can as well; call 1-800-847-7536 or go to\nwww.GEICO.com.) And they\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire acquired GEICO in two stages. In 1976-80 we bought about one-third of the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nstock for $47 million. Over the years, large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position to\ngrow to about 50% without our having bought any more shares. Then, on January 2, 1996, we acquired the\nremaining 50% of GEICO for $2.3 billion in cash, about 50 times the cost of our original purchase.\n</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>An old Wall Street joke gets close to our experience:\n</p>\n<p>Customer: Thanks for putting me in XYZ stock at 5. I hear it\xe2\x80\x99s up to 18.\n</p>\n<p>Broker: Yes, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning. In fact, the company is doing so well now,\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s an even better buy at 18 than it was when you made your purchase.\n</p>\n<p>Customer: Damn, I knew I should have waited.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s growth may slow in 2010. U.S. vehicle registrations are actually down because of slumping\nauto sales. Moreover, high unemployment is causing a growing number of drivers to go uninsured. (That\xe2\x80\x99s illegal\nalmost everywhere, but if you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost your job and still want to drive . . .) Our \xe2\x80\x9clow-cost producer\xe2\x80\x9d status,\nhowever, is sure to give us significant gains in the future. In 1995, GEICO was the country\xe2\x80\x99s sixth largest auto\ninsurer; now we are number three. The company\xe2\x80\x99s float has grown from $2.7 billion to $9.6 billion. Equally\nimportant, GEICO has operated at an underwriting profit in 13 of the 14 years Berkshire has owned it.\n</p>\n<p>I became excited about GEICO in January 1951, when I first visited the company as a 20-year-old\nstudent. Thanks to Tony, I\xe2\x80\x99m even more excited today.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>A hugely important event in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came into\nour office in Omaha \xe2\x80\x93 and I immediately knew we had found a superstar. (He had been discovered by Mike\nGoldberg, now elevated to St. Mike.)\n</p>\n<p>We immediately put Ajit in charge of National Indemnity\xe2\x80\x99s small and struggling reinsurance operation.\nOver the years, he has built this business into a one-of-a-kind giant in the insurance world.\n</p>\n<p>Staffed today by only 30 people, Ajit\xe2\x80\x99s operation has set records for transaction size in several areas of\ninsurance. Ajit writes billion-dollar limits \xe2\x80\x93 and then keeps every dime of the risk instead of laying it off with\nother insurers. Three years ago, he took over huge liabilities from Lloyds, allowing it to clean up its relationship\nwith 27,972 participants (\xe2\x80\x9cnames\xe2\x80\x9d) who had written problem-ridden policies that at one point threatened the\nsurvival of this 322-year-old institution. The premium for that single contract was $7.1 billion. During 2009, he\nnegotiated a life reinsurance contract that could produce $50 billion of premium for us over the next 50 or so\nyears.\n</p>\n<p>Ajit\xe2\x80\x99s business is just the opposite of GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s. At that company, we have millions of small policies\nthat largely renew year after year. Ajit writes relatively few policies, and the mix changes significantly from year\nto year. Throughout the world, he is known as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needs\nto be insured.\n</p>\n<p>If Charlie, I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat \xe2\x80\x93 and you can only save one of us \xe2\x80\x93 swim to Ajit.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Our third insurance powerhouse is General Re. Some years back this operation was troubled; now it is\na gleaming jewel in our insurance crown.\n</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Tad Montross, General Re had an outstanding underwriting year in 2009, while\nalso delivering us unusually large amounts of float per dollar of premium volume. Alongside General Re\xe2\x80\x99s P/C\nbusiness, Tad and his associates have developed a major life reinsurance operation that has grown increasingly\nvaluable.\n</p>\n<p>Last year General Re finally attained 100% ownership of Cologne Re, which since 1995 has been a\nkey \xe2\x80\x93 though only partially-owned \xe2\x80\x93 part of our presence around the world. Tad and I will be visiting Cologne in\nSeptember to thank its managers for their important contribution to Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Finally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, the\nfloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\n</p>\n<p>Here is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\n</p>\n<p>Underwriting Profit Yearend Float\n</p>\n<p>(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2009 2008 2009 2008\n</p>\n<p>General Re . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 477 $ 342 $21,014 $21,074\nBH Reinsurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 349 1,324 26,223 24,221\nGEICO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 649 916 9,613 8,454\nOther Primary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 84 210 5,061 4,739\n</p>\n<p>$1,559 $2,792 $61,911 $58,488\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>And now a painful confession: Last year your chairman closed the book on a very expensive business\nfiasco entirely of his own making.\n</p>\n<p>For many years I had struggled to think of side products that we could offer our millions of loyal\nGEICO customers. Unfortunately, I finally succeeded, coming up with a brilliant insight that we should market\nour own credit card. I reasoned that GEICO policyholders were likely to be good credit risks and, assuming we\noffered an attractive card, would likely favor us with their business. We got business all right \xe2\x80\x93 but of the wrong\ntype.\n</p>\n<p>Our pre-tax losses from credit-card operations came to about $6.3 million before I finally woke up. We\nthen sold our $98 million portfolio of troubled receivables for 55\xc2\xa2 on the dollar, losing an additional $44 million.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s managers, it should be emphasized, were never enthusiastic about my idea. They warned me\nthat instead of getting the cream of GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s customers we would get the \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 well, let\xe2\x80\x99s call it the\nnon-cream. I subtly indicated that I was older and wiser.\n</p>\n<p>I was just older.\n</p>\n<p>Regulated Utility Business\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire has an 89.5% interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of\nutility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million end\nusers make it the U.K.\xe2\x80\x99s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 725,000\nelectric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million\nelectric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about\n8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.\n</p>\n<p>MidAmerican has two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel. In addition, my long-time friend,\nWalter Scott, along with his family, has a major ownership position in the company. Walter brings extraordinary\nbusiness savvy to any operation. Ten years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have reinforced my original\nbelief: Berkshire couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have better partners. They are truly a dream team.\n</p>\n<p>Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the\nU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000\nagents. Though last year was again a terrible year for home sales, HomeServices earned a modest sum. It also\nacquired a firm in Chicago and will add other quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible\nprices. A decade from now, HomeServices is likely to be much larger.\n</p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Here are some key figures on MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s operations:\n</p>\n<p>Earnings (in millions)\n</p>\n<p>2009 2008\n</p>\n<p>U.K. utilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 248 $ 339\nIowa utility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 285 425\nWestern utilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 788 703\nPipelines . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 457 595\nHomeServices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43 (45)\nOther (net) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 186\n</p>\n<p>Operating earnings before corporate interest and taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,846 2,203\nConstellation Energy * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \xe2\x80\x94 1,092\nInterest, other than to Berkshire . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Permitting and construction periods for generation and major transmission facilities\nstretch way out, so it is incumbent on us to be far-sighted. We, in turn, look to our utilities\xe2\x80\x99 regulators (acting on\nbehalf of our customers) to allow us an appropriate return on the huge amounts of capital we must deploy to meet\nfuture needs. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours.\n</p>\n<p>Dave and Greg make sure we do just that. National research companies consistently rank our Iowa and\nWestern utilities at or near the top of their industry. Similarly, among the 43 U.S. pipelines ranked by a firm\nnamed Mastio, our Kern River and Northern Natural properties tied for second place.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for\nthe future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. Since we purchased MidAmerican ten\nyears ago, it has never paid a dividend. We have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties in\neach of the territories we serve. As one dramatic example, in the last three years our Iowa and Western utilities\nhave earned $2.5 billion, while in this same period spending $3 billion on wind generation facilities.\n</p>\n<p>MidAmerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and, to society\xe2\x80\x99s credit, it has\nreciprocated: With few exceptions, our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever-\nincreasing sums of capital we must invest. Going forward, we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories in\nthe manner they expect. We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds we\ninvest.\n</p>\n<p>In earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the\nbest businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require little\nincremental investment to grow. We are fortunate to own a number of such businesses, and we would love to buy\nmore. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quite\nwilling to enter businesses that regularly require large capital expenditures. We expect only that these businesses\nhave reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectations\nare met \xe2\x80\x93 and we believe that they will be \xe2\x80\x93 Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s ever-growing collection of good to great businesses\nshould produce above-average, though certainly not spectacular, returns in the decades ahead.\n</p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Our BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemble\nthose of our electric utilities. In both cases we provide fundamental services that are, and will remain, essential to\nthe economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will require\nheavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan far\nahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulators\nwho will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investments\nrequired to maintain, replace and expand the plant.\n</p>\n<p>We see a \xe2\x80\x9csocial compact\xe2\x80\x9d existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the case\nwith our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties to\nthe compact should \xe2\x80\x93 and we believe will \xe2\x80\x93 understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages good\nbehavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economic\npotential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems. We will do our part to see that they\nexist.\n</p>\n<p>In the future, BNSF results will be included in this \xe2\x80\x9cregulated utility\xe2\x80\x9d section. Aside from the two\nbusinesses having similar underlying economic characteristics, both are logical users of substantial amounts of\ndebt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Both will retain most of their earnings. Both will earn and invest large\nsums in good times or bad, though the railroad will display the greater cyclicality. Overall, we expect this\nregulated sector to deliver significantly increased earnings over time, albeit at the cost of our investing many tens\n\xe2\x80\x93 yes, tens \xe2\x80\x93 of billions of dollars of incremental equity capital.\n</p>\n<p>Manufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\n</p>\n<p>Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

The major exception was McLane, our distributor of groceries, confections and\nnon-food items to thousands of retail outlets, the largest by far Wal-Mart.\n</p>\n<p>Grady Rosier led McLane to record pre-tax earnings of $344 million, which even so amounted to only\nslightly more than one cent per dollar on its huge sales of $31.2 billion. McLane employs a vast array of physical\nassets \xe2\x80\x93 practically all of which it owns \xe2\x80\x93 including 3,242 trailers, 2,309 tractors and 55 distribution centers with\n15.2 million square feet of space. McLane\xe2\x80\x99s prime asset, however, is Grady.\n</p>\n<p>We had a number of companies at which profits improved even as sales contracted, always an\nexceptional managerial achievement. Here are the CEOs who made it happen:\n</p>\n<p>COMPANY CEO\n</p>\n<p>Benjamin Moore (paint) Denis Abrams\nBorsheims (jewelry retailing) Susan Jacques\nH. H. Brown (manufacturing and retailing of shoes) Jim Issler\nCTB (agricultural equipment) Vic Mancinelli\nDairy Queen John Gainor\nNebraska Furniture Mart (furniture retailing) Ron and Irv Blumkin\nPampered Chef (direct sales of kitchen tools) Marla Gottschalk\nSee\xe2\x80\x99s (manufacturing and retailing of candy) Brad Kinstler\nStar Furniture (furniture retailing) Bill Kimbrell\n</p>\n<p>Among the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector, both\nMarmon and Iscar turned in relatively strong performances. Frank Ptak\xe2\x80\x99s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-tax\nprofit margin, a record high. Though the company\xe2\x80\x99s sales were down 27%, Frank\xe2\x80\x99s cost-conscious management\nmitigated the decline in earnings.\n</p>\n<p>Nothing stops Israel-based Iscar \xe2\x80\x93 not wars, recessions or competitors. The world\xe2\x80\x99s two other leading\nsuppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of the\nyear. Though Iscar\xe2\x80\x99s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, even\nwhile it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about last\nyear. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of Eitan\nWertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny Goldman will see to that.\n</p>\n<p>Every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely\nin 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an\n82.5% decline from $1.295 billion in 2006, when construction activity was booming. These businesses continue\nto bump along the bottom, though their competitive positions remain undented.\n</p>\n<p>The major problem for Berkshire last year was NetJets, an aviation operation that offers fractional\nownership of jets. Over the years, it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier company\nin its industry, with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined. Overall, our\ndominance in the field remains unchallenged.\n</p>\n<p>NetJets\xe2\x80\x99 business operation, however, has been another story. In the eleven years that we have owned\nthe company, it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million. Moreover, the company\xe2\x80\x99s debt has soared\nfrom $102 million at the time of purchase to $1.9 billion in April of last year. Without Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of\nthis debt, NetJets would have been out of business. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that I failed you in letting NetJets descend into this\ncondition. But, luckily, I have been bailed out.\n</p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Dave Sokol, the enormously talented builder and operator of MidAmerican Energy, became CEO of\nNetJets in August. His leadership has been transforming: Debt has already been reduced to $1.4 billion, and, after\nsuffering a staggering loss of $711 million in 2009, the company is now solidly profitable.\n</p>\n<p>Most important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-line\nstandards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets\xe2\x80\x99 previous CEO and the father of the fractional-\nownership industry, insisted upon. Dave and I have the strongest possible personal interest in maintaining these\nstandards because we and our families use NetJets for almost all of our flying, as do many of our directors and\nmanagers. None of us are assigned special planes nor crews. We receive exactly the same treatment as any other\nowner, meaning we pay the same prices as everyone else does when we are using our personal contracts. In short,\nwe eat our own cooking. In the aviation business, no other testimonial means more.\n</p>\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\n</p>\n<p>Our largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading producer of modular and\nmanufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers were\nFleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All have\nsince gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000 units in 1999 to 60,000 units in\n2009.\n</p>\n<p>The industry is in shambles for two reasons, the first of which must be lived with if the U.S. economy\nis to recover. This reason concerns U.S. housing starts (including apartment units). In 2009, starts were 554,000,\nby far the lowest number in the 50 years for which we have data. Paradoxically, this is good news.\n</p>\n<p>People thought it was good news a few years back when housing starts \xe2\x80\x93 the supply side of the picture\n\xe2\x80\x93 were running about two million annually. But household formations \xe2\x80\x93 the demand side \xe2\x80\x93 only amounted to\nabout 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too many\nhouses.\n</p>\n<p>There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the\ndestruction of autos that occurred with the \xe2\x80\x9ccash-for-clunkers\xe2\x80\x9d program; (2) speed up household formations by,\nsay, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reduce\nnew housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations.\n</p>\n<p>Our country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential\nhousing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certain\nlocalities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. Prices will remain far below \xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d levels, of course,\nbut for every seller (or lender) hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. Indeed, many families that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nafford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst.\n</p>\n<p>The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive\ndifferential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let me\nunderscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary that\nfollows with special care. That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problems\nfor both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton.\n</p>\n<p>The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie\nMac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typically\nbe securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers of\nconventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 51\xe2\x81\x844%. In\naddition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, an\naction that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels.\n</p>\n<p>In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a\nmeritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s\nhomes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however \xe2\x80\x93 and, of course, most buyers do \xe2\x80\x93 the\ndifference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home.\n</p>\n<p>12</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Last year I told you why our buyers \xe2\x80\x93 generally people with low incomes \xe2\x80\x93 performed so well as credit\nrisks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it.\nConsequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nmaking \xe2\x80\x9cliar\xe2\x80\x99s loans\xe2\x80\x9d) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs, had\nhealth problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simply\nbecause house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s delinquencies and\ndefaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems.\n</p>\n<p>We have tried to qualify more of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 loans for treatment similar to those available on the\nsite-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsible\nhabits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to the\nfactory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren\xe2\x80\x99t broadened, so as to open\nlow-cost financing to all who meet down-payment and income standards, the manufactured-home industry seems\ndestined to struggle and dwindle.\n</p>\n<p>Even under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though well\nbelow its potential. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a better manager than CEO Kevin Clayton, who treats Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s interests\nas if they were his own. Our product is first-class, inexpensive and constantly being improved. Moreover, we will\ncontinue to use Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s credit to support Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage program, convinced as we are of its soundness.\nEven so, Berkshire can\xe2\x80\x99t borrow at a rate approaching that available to government agencies. This handicap will\nlimit sales, hurting both Clayton and a multitude of worthy families who long for a low-cost home.\n</p>\n<p>In the following table, Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s earnings are net of the company\xe2\x80\x99s payment to Berkshire for the use of\nits credit. Offsetting this cost to Clayton is an identical amount of income credited to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s finance\noperation and included in \xe2\x80\x9cOther Income.\xe2\x80\x9d The cost and income amount was $116 million in 2009 and $92\nmillion in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>The table also illustrates how severely our furniture (CORT) and trailer (XTRA) leasing operations\nhave been hit by the recession.

We\npurchased these five positions in the last 18 months. Setting aside the significant equity potential they provide us,\nthese holdings deliver us an aggregate of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Finally, we owned\n76,777,029 shares (22.5%) of BNSF at yearend, which we then carried at $85.78 per share, but which have\nsubsequently been melded into our purchase of the entire company.\n</p>\n<p>In 2009, our largest sales were in ConocoPhillips, Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, Procter &amp; Gamble and Johnson &amp; Johnson\n(sales of the latter occurring after we had built our position earlier in the year). Charlie and I believe that all of\nthese stocks will likely trade higher in the future. We made some sales early in 2009 to raise cash for our Dow\nand Swiss Re purchases and late in the year made other sales in anticipation of our BNSF purchase.\n</p>\n<p>14</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We told you last year that very unusual conditions then existed in the corporate and municipal bond\nmarkets and that these securities were ridiculously cheap relative to U.S. Treasuries. We backed this view with\nsome purchases, but I should have done far more. Big opportunities come infrequently. When it\xe2\x80\x99s raining gold,\nreach for a bucket, not a thimble.\n</p>\n<p>We entered 2008 with $44.3 billion of cash-equivalents, and we have since retained operating earnings\nof $17 billion. Nevertheless, at yearend 2009, our cash was down to $30.6 billion (with $8 billion earmarked for\nthe BNSF acquisition). We\xe2\x80\x99ve put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years. It\xe2\x80\x99s been an\nideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are\nupbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance. In the end, what counts in investing is what you\npay for a business \xe2\x80\x93 through the purchase of a small piece of it in the stock market \xe2\x80\x93 and what that business earns\nin the succeeding decade or two.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Last year I wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts, which were then the subject of both\ncontroversy and misunderstanding. For that discussion, please go to www.berkshirehathaway.com.\n</p>\n<p>We have since changed only a few of our positions. Some credit contracts have run off. The terms of\nabout 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike prices\nmaterially reduced. In these modifications, no money changed hands.\n</p>\n<p>A few points from last year\xe2\x80\x99s discussion are worth repeating:\n</p>\n<p>(1) Though it\xe2\x80\x99s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime,\neven when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in the\ncalculation. Our derivatives float \xe2\x80\x93 which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float I\ndescribed earlier \xe2\x80\x93 was about $6.3 billion at yearend.\n</p>\n<p>(2) Only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. At last year\xe2\x80\x99s low\npoint in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of the\nderivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put up\ncontinue to earn money for our account.\n</p>\n<p>(3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect\nour reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings.\nThat thought certainly fit 2009\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses from\nderivatives valuations that were part of our reported earnings last year:\n</p>\n<p>Quarter $ Gain (Loss) in Billions\n</p>\n<p>1 (1.517)\n2 2.357\n3 1.732\n4 1.052\n</p>\n<p>As we\xe2\x80\x99ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report to\nyou, we will continue to separate out these figures (as we do realized investment gains and losses) so that you can\nmore clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivatives\ncontracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. We expect also to earn\nfurther investment income over the life of our contracts.\n</p>\n<p>15</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We have long invested in derivatives contracts that Charlie and I think are mispriced, just as we try to\ninvest in mispriced stocks and bonds. Indeed, we first reported to you that we held such contracts in early 1998.\nThe dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society \xe2\x80\x93 dangers of which we\xe2\x80\x99ve long warned, and\nthat can be dynamite \xe2\x80\x93 arise when these contracts lead to leverage and/or counterparty risk that is extreme. At\nBerkshire nothing like that has occurred \xe2\x80\x93 nor will it.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s my job to keep Berkshire far away from such problems. Charlie and I believe that a CEO must not\ndelegate risk control. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor every derivatives\ncontract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such as\nMidAmerican, and the minor runoff contracts at General Re. If Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be my fault.\nIt will not be because of misjudgments made by a Risk Committee or Chief Risk Officer.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>In my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its\nCEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he\xe2\x80\x99s incapable of handling that job, he should look for other\nemployment. And if he fails at it \xe2\x80\x93 with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees \xe2\x80\x93\nthe financial consequences for him and his board should be severe.\n</p>\n<p>It has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country\xe2\x80\x99s largest financial\ninstitutions. Yet they have borne the burden, with 90% or more of the value of their holdings wiped out in most\ncases of failure. Collectively, they have lost more than $500 billion in just the four largest financial fiascos of the\nlast two years. To say these owners have been \xe2\x80\x9cbailed-out\xe2\x80\x9d is to make a mockery of the term.\n</p>\n<p>The CEOs and directors of the failed companies, however, have largely gone unscathed. Their fortunes may\nhave been diminished by the disasters they oversaw, but they still live in grand style. It is the behavior of these\nCEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by their\nrecklessness, they should pay a heavy price \xe2\x80\x93 one not reimbursable by the companies they\xe2\x80\x99ve damaged nor by\ninsurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; some\nmeaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well.\n</p>\n<p>An Inconvenient Truth (Boardroom Overheating)\n</p>\n<p>Our subsidiaries made a few small \xe2\x80\x9cbolt-on\xe2\x80\x9d acquisitions last year for cash, but our blockbuster deal\nwith BNSF required us to issue about 95,000 Berkshire shares that amounted to 6.1% of those previously\noutstanding. Charlie and I enjoy issuing Berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy.\n</p>\n<p>The reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at the\ncurrent market price, why in the world should we \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d a significant part of the company at that same inadequate\nprice by issuing our stock in a merger?\n</p>\n<p>In evaluating a stock-for-stock offer, shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus on\nthe market price of the acquirer\xe2\x80\x99s shares that are to be given them. But they also expect the transaction to deliver\nthem the intrinsic value of their own shares \xe2\x80\x93 the ones they are giving up. If shares of a prospective acquirer are\nselling below their intrinsic value, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an all-stock deal. You\nsimply can\xe2\x80\x99t exchange an undervalued stock for a fully-valued one without hurting your shareholders.\n</p>\n<p>Imagine, if you will, Company A and Company B, of equal size and both with businesses intrinsically\nworth $100 per share. Both of their stocks, however, sell for $80 per share. The CEO of A, long on confidence\nand short on smarts, offers 11\xe2\x81\x844 shares of A for each share of B, correctly telling his directors that B is worth $100\nper share. He will neglect to explain, though, that what he is giving will cost his shareholders $125 in intrinsic\nvalue. If the directors are mathematically challenged as well, and a deal is therefore completed, the shareholders\nof B will end up owning 55.6% of A &amp; B\xe2\x80\x99s combined assets and A\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders will own 44.4%. Not everyone\nat A, it should be noted, is a loser from this nonsensical transaction. Its CEO now runs a company twice as large\nas his original domain, in a world where size tends to correlate with both prestige and compensation.\n</p>\n<p>16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>If an acquirer\xe2\x80\x99s stock is overvalued, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different story: Using it as a currency works to the acquirer\xe2\x80\x99s\nadvantage. That\xe2\x80\x99s why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances of\nstock by sly promoters. Going by the market value of their stock, they can afford to overpay because they are, in\neffect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960s\nhaving been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in this\nway. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there is\nplenty of private snickering.)\n</p>\n<p>In our BNSF acquisition, the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at $100 per share.\nThe cost to us, however, was somewhat higher since 40% of the $100 was delivered in our shares, which Charlie\nand I believed to be worth more than their market value. Fortunately, we had long owned a substantial amount of\nBNSF stock that we purchased in the market for cash. All told, therefore, only about 30% of our cost overall was\npaid with Berkshire shares.\n</p>\n<p>In the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock was\noffset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood and\nliked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. We\nalso like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the final\ndecision was a close one. If we had needed to use more stock to make the acquisition, it would in fact have made\nno sense. We would have then been giving up more than we were getting.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>I have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with the\ndirectors being instructed by high-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?). Invariably, the bankers\ngive the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased, with emphasis on why it is\nworth far more than its market price. In more than fifty years of board memberships, however, never have I heard\nthe investment bankers (or management!) discuss the true value of what is being given. When a deal involved the\nissuance of the acquirer\xe2\x80\x99s stock, they simply used market value to measure the cost. They did this even though\nthey would have argued that the acquirer\xe2\x80\x99s stock price was woefully inadequate \xe2\x80\x93 absolutely no indicator of its\nreal value \xe2\x80\x93 had a takeover bid for the acquirer instead been the subject up for discussion.\n</p>\n<p>When stock is the currency being contemplated in an acquisition and when directors are hearing from\nan advisor, it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors should\nhire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not\ngoing through. Absent this drastic remedy, our recommendation in respect to the use of advisors remains: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\nask the barber whether you need a haircut.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist telling you a true story from long ago. We owned stock in a large well-run bank that for\ndecades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bank\nimmediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers \xe2\x80\x93 fine people and able bankers \xe2\x80\x93 not\nunexpectedly began to behave like teenage boys who had just discovered girls.\n</p>\n<p>They soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristics\nin such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that\xe2\x80\x99s why\nwe had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio. Alongside,\nthough, the small-bank owner was being wooed by other large banks in the state and was holding out for a price\nclose to three times book value. Moreover, he wanted stock, not cash.\n</p>\n<p>Naturally, our fellows caved in and agreed to this value-destroying deal. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to show that we are\nin the hunt. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a small deal,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, as if only major harm to shareholders would have been a\nlegitimate reason for holding back. Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s reaction at the time: \xe2\x80\x9cAre we supposed to applaud because the dog\nthat fouls our lawn is a Chihuahua rather than a Saint Bernard?\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The seller of the smaller bank \xe2\x80\x93 no fool \xe2\x80\x93 then delivered one final demand in his negotiations. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\nthe merger,\xe2\x80\x9d he in effect said, perhaps using words that were phrased more diplomatically than these, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going\nto be a large shareholder of your bank, and it will represent a huge portion of my net worth. You have to promise\nme, therefore, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll never again do a deal this dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Yes, the merger went through. The owner of the small bank became richer, we became poorer, and the\nmanagers of the big bank \xe2\x80\x93 newly bigger \xe2\x80\x93 lived happily ever after.\n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>Our best guess is that 35,000 people attended the annual meeting last year (up from 12 \xe2\x80\x93 no zeros\nomitted \xe2\x80\x93 in 1981). With our shareholder population much expanded, we expect even more this year. Therefore,\nwe will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. There will be no change, however, in our enthusiasm\nfor having you attend. Charlie and I like to meet you, answer your questions and \xe2\x80\x93 best of all \xe2\x80\x93 have you buy lots\nof goods from our businesses.\n</p>\n<p>The meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 1st. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest\nCenter at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the\nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\xe2\x80\x99s stands) will last until 3:30. After a\nshort recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\xe2\x80\x99s\nquestion periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)\n</p>\n<p>The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did\nyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. But you can do better. (A friendly warning: If I find sales\nare lagging, I get testy and lock the exits.)\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For\nat least 50% of you, I believe we can.\n</p>\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. Among the more than 30 books and DVDs it will offer are two new\nbooks by my sons: Howard\xe2\x80\x99s Fragile, a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of struggle\naround the globe and Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Life Is What You Make It. Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my\nsister Doris\xe2\x80\x99s biography, a story focusing on her remarkable philanthropic activities. Also available will be Poor\nCharlie\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack, the story of my partner. This book is something of a publishing miracle \xe2\x80\x93 never advertised,\nyet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site. (Should you need to ship your book\npurchases, a nearby shipping service will be available.)\n</p>\n<p>If you are a big spender \xe2\x80\x93 or, for that matter, merely a gawker \xe2\x80\x93 visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of\nthe Omaha airport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that\nwill get your pulse racing.\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who\nhandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,\nbut work with Carol and you will get one.\n</p>\n<p>18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make\nyour purchases between Thursday, April 29th and Monday, May 3rd inclusive, and also present your meeting\ncredential. The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that\nnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made\nan exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through\nSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a\nBerkyville BBQ to which you are all invited.\n</p>\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 30th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 2nd, from 9\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\n</p>\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 26th through Saturday, May 8th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that\nshows you are a Berkshire holder. Enter with rhinestones; leave with diamonds. My daughter tells me that the\nmore you buy, the more you save (kids say the darnedest things).\n</p>\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers \xe2\x80\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \xe2\x80\x93 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.\n</p>\n<p>Our special treat for shareholders this year will be the return of my friend, Ariel Hsing, the country\xe2\x80\x99s\ntop-ranked junior table tennis player (and a good bet to win at the Olympics some day). Now 14, Ariel came to\nthe annual meeting four years ago and demolished all comers, including me. (You can witness my humiliating\ndefeat on YouTube; just type in Ariel Hsing Berkshire.)\n</p>\n<p>Naturally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been plotting a comeback and will take her on outside of Borsheims at 1:00 p.m. on\nSunday. It will be a three-point match, and after I soften her up, all shareholders are invited to try their luck at\nsimilar three-point contests. Winners will be given a box of See\xe2\x80\x99s candy. We will have equipment available, but\nbring your own paddle if you think it will help. (It won\xe2\x80\x99t.)\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 2nd, and will be\nserving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year, though, it was overwhelmed by demand. With many more diners\nexpected this year, I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked my friend, Donna Sheehan, at Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 another favorite restaurant of mine \xe2\x80\x93 to\nserve shareholders on Sunday as well. (Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s giant root beer float is mandatory for any fan of fine dining.) I\nplan to eat at both restaurants: All of the weekend action makes me really hungry, and I have favorite dishes at\neach spot. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and at\nPiccolo\xe2\x80\x99s call 402-342-9038.\n</p>\n<p>Regrettably, we will not be able to have a reception for international visitors this year. Our count grew\nto about 800 last year, and my simply signing one item per person took about 21\xe2\x81\x842 hours. Since we expect even\nmore international visitors this year, Charlie and I decided we must drop this function. But be assured, we\nwelcome every international visitor who comes.\n</p>\n<p>Last year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting and\nreceived many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. We will therefore again have the same three\nfinancial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have\nsubmitted to them by e-mail.\n</p>\n<p>19</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at\ncloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross\nSorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted, each journalist will\nchoose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me\nyour question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise and include no more than two questions\nin any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if\nyour question is selected.)\n</p>\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists will pick some tough ones and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we like it.\n</p>\n<p>We will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholders\nwishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with\nthose from the winning shareholders. We\xe2\x80\x99ve added 30 minutes to the question time and will probably have time\nfor about 30 questions from each group.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>At 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrific\nparents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came\nequipped with a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to that\nexperienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society\xe2\x80\x99s well-being. Moreover, we have\nlong had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. Indeed,\nover the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work. If pushed, we\nwould gladly pay substantial sums to have our jobs (but don\xe2\x80\x99t tell the Comp Committee).\n</p>\n<p>Nothing, however, is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nannual meeting. So join us on May 1st at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\nthere.\n</p>\n<p>February 26, 2010 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n</p>\n<p>P.S.
