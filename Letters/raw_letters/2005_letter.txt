If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500 \nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index \nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. </p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> \nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \n</p>\n<p> \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \n \n Our gain in net worth during 2005 was $5.6 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%.  Over the last 41 years (that is, since present management \ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $59,377, a rate of 21.5% compounded annually.* \n \n Berkshire had a decent year in 2005.  We initiated five acquisitions (two of which have yet to \nclose) and most of our operating subsidiaries prospered.  Even our insurance business in its entirety did \nwell, though Hurricane Katrina inflicted record losses on both Berkshire and the industry.  We estimate our \nloss from Katrina at $2.5 billion \xe2\x80\x93 and her ugly sisters, Rita and Wilma, cost us an additional $.9 billion.  \n \n Credit GEICO \xe2\x80\x93 and its brilliant CEO, Tony Nicely \xe2\x80\x93 for our stellar insurance results in a disaster-\nridden year.  One statistic stands out: In just two years, GEICO improved its productivity by 32%.  \nRemarkably, employment fell by 4% even as policy count grew by 26% \xe2\x80\x93 and more gains are in store.  \nWhen we drive unit costs down in such a dramatic manner, we can offer ever-greater value to our \ncustomers.  The payoff: Last year, GEICO gained market-share, earned commendable profits and \nstrengthened its brand.  If you have a new son or grandson in 2006, name him Tony. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n My goal in writing this report is to give you the information you need to estimate Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \nintrinsic value.  I say \xe2\x80\x9cestimate\xe2\x80\x9d because calculations of intrinsic value, though all-important, are \nnecessarily imprecise and often seriously wrong.  The more uncertain the future of a business, the more \npossibility there is that the calculation will be wildly off-base.  (For an explanation of intrinsic value, see \npages 77 \xe2\x80\x93 78.)  Here Berkshire has some advantages: a wide variety of relatively-stable earnings streams, \ncombined with great liquidity and minimum debt.  These factors mean that Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value can \nbe more precisely calculated than can the intrinsic value of most companies. \n \n Yet if precision is aided by Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s financial characteristics, the job of calculating intrinsic \nvalue has been made more complex by the mere presence of so many earnings streams.  Back in 1965, \nwhen we owned only a small textile operation, the task of calculating intrinsic value was a snap.  Now we \nown 68 distinct businesses with widely disparate operating and financial characteristics.  This array of \nunrelated enterprises, coupled with our massive investment holdings, makes it impossible for you to simply \nexamine our consolidated financial statements and arrive at an informed estimate of intrinsic value. \n \n We have attempted to ease this problem by clustering our businesses into four logical groups, each \nof which we discuss later in this report.  In these discussions, we will provide the key figures for both the \ngroup and its important components.  Of course, the value of Berkshire may be either greater or less than \nthe sum of these four parts.  The outcome depends on whether our many units function better or worse by \nbeing part of a larger enterprise and whether capital allocation improves or deteriorates when it is under the \ndirection of a holding company.  In other words, does Berkshire ownership bring anything to the party, or \nwould our shareholders be better off if they directly owned shares in each of our 68 businesses?  These are \nimportant questions but ones that you will have to answer for yourself. \n \n Before we look at our individual businesses, however, let\xe2\x80\x99s review two sets of figures that show \nwhere we\xe2\x80\x99ve come from and where we are now.  The first set is the amount of investments (including cash \nand cash-equivalents) we own on a per-share basis.  In making this calculation, we exclude investments \nheld in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings: \n  \n *All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares, the successor to the only stock that \nthe company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of \nthe A. \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> \nYear\n</p>\n<p> \nPer-Share Investments* \n</p>\n<p>  \n1965 ..................................................................... $         4 \n1975 ..................................................................... 159 \n1985 ..................................................................... 2,407 \n1995 ..................................................................... 21,817 \n2005 ..................................................................... $74,129\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2005....................       28.0% \nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2005....................       13.0% \n</p>\n<p>  *Net of minority interests \n \n In addition to these marketable securities, which with minor exceptions are held in our insurance \ncompanies, we own a wide variety of non-insurance businesses.  Below, we show the pre-tax earnings \n(excluding goodwill amortization) of these businesses, again on a per-share basis: \n</p>\n<p> \nYear\n</p>\n<p> \nPer-Share Earnings* \n</p>\n<p>  \n1965 ..................................................................... $        4 \n1975 ..................................................................... 4 \n1985 ..................................................................... 52 \n1995 ..................................................................... 175 \n2005 ..................................................................... $2,441\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2005....................       17.2% \nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2005....................       30.2% \n</p>\n<p>  *Pre-tax and net of minority interests \n \n When growth rates are under discussion, it will pay you to be suspicious as to why the beginning \nand terminal years have been selected.  If either year was aberrational, any calculation of growth will be \ndistorted.  In particular, a base year in which earnings were poor can produce a breathtaking, but \nmeaningless, growth rate.  In the table above, however, the base year of 1965 was abnormally good; \nBerkshire earned more money in that year than it did in all but one of the previous ten. \n \n As you can see from the two tables, the comparative growth rates of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s two elements of \nvalue have changed in the last decade, a result reflecting our ever-increasing emphasis on business \nacquisitions.  Nevertheless, Charlie Munger, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I want to \nincrease the figures in both tables.  In this ambition, we hope \xe2\x80\x93 metaphorically \xe2\x80\x93 to avoid the fate of the \nelderly couple who had been romantically challenged for some time.  As they finished dinner on their 50th \nanniversary, however, the wife \xe2\x80\x93 stimulated by soft music, wine and candlelight \xe2\x80\x93 felt a long-absent tickle \nand demurely suggested to her husband that they go upstairs and make love.  He agonized for a moment \nand then replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do one or the other, but not both.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \nAcquisitions \n \n Over the years, our current businesses, in aggregate, should deliver modest growth in operating \nearnings.  But they will not in themselves produce truly satisfactory gains.  We will need major acquisitions \nto get that job done. \n \n In this quest, 2005 was encouraging.  We agreed to five purchases: two that were completed last \nyear, one that closed after yearend and two others that we expect to close soon.  None of the deals involve \nthe issuance of Berkshire shares.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a crucial, but often ignored, point: When a management proudly \nacquires another company for stock, the shareholders of the acquirer are concurrently selling part of their \ninterest in everything they own.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve made this kind of deal a few times myself \xe2\x80\x93 and, on balance, my \nactions have cost you money. \n \n</p>\n<p> 4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Here are last year\xe2\x80\x99s purchases:  \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 On June 30 we bought Medical Protective Company (\xe2\x80\x9cMedPro\xe2\x80\x9d), a 106-year-old medical \nmalpractice insurer based in Fort Wayne.  Malpractice insurance is tough to underwrite and has \nproved to be a graveyard for many insurers.  MedPro nevertheless should do well.  It will have the \nattitudinal advantage that all Berkshire insurers share, wherein underwriting discipline trumps all \nother goals.  Additionally, as part of Berkshire, MedPro has financial strength far exceeding that of \nits competitors, a quality assuring doctors that long-to-settle claims will not end up back on their \ndoorstep because their insurer failed.  Finally, the company has a smart and energetic CEO, Tim \nKenesey, who instinctively thinks like a Berkshire manager. \n</p>\n<p> \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Forest River, our second acquisition, closed on August 31.  A couple of months earlier, on June \n</p>\n<p>21, I received a two-page fax telling me \xe2\x80\x93 point by point \xe2\x80\x93 why Forest River met the acquisition \ncriteria we set forth on page 25 of this report.  I had not before heard of the company, a \nrecreational vehicle manufacturer with $1.6 billion of sales, nor of Pete Liegl, its owner and \nmanager.  But the fax made sense, and I immediately asked for more figures.  These came the next \nmorning, and that afternoon I made Pete an offer.  On June 28, we shook hands on a deal. \n</p>\n<p> \nPete is a remarkable entrepreneur.  Some years back, he sold his business, then far smaller than \ntoday, to an LBO operator who promptly began telling him how to run the place.  Before long, \nPete left, and the business soon sunk into bankruptcy.  Pete then repurchased it.  You can be sure \nthat I won\xe2\x80\x99t be telling Pete how to manage his operation. \n</p>\n<p> \nForest River has 60 plants, 5,400 employees and has consistently gained share in the RV business, \nwhile also expanding into other areas such as boats.  Pete is 61 \xe2\x80\x93 and definitely in an acceleration \nmode.  Read the piece from RV Business that accompanies this report, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see why Pete and \nBerkshire are made for each other. \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 On November 12, 2005, an article ran in The Wall Street Journal dealing with Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s unusual \nacquisition and managerial practices.  In it Pete declared, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was easier to sell my business than to \nrenew my driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p> \nIn New York, Cathy Baron Tamraz read the article, and it struck a chord.  On November 21, she \nsent me a letter that began, \xe2\x80\x9cAs president of Business Wire, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to introduce you to my \ncompany, as I believe it fits the profile of Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary companies as detailed in \na recent Wall Street Journal article.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \nBy the time I finished Cathy\xe2\x80\x99s two-page letter, I felt Business Wire and Berkshire were a fit.  I \nparticularly liked her penultimate paragraph: \xe2\x80\x9cWe run a tight ship and keep unnecessary spending \nunder wraps.  No secretaries or management layers here.  Yet we\xe2\x80\x99ll invest big dollars to gain a \ntechnological advantage and move the business forward.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \nI promptly gave Cathy a call, and before long Berkshire had reached agreement with Business \nWire\xe2\x80\x99s controlling shareholder, Lorry Lokey, who founded the company in 1961 (and who had \njust made Cathy CEO).  I love success stories like Lorry\xe2\x80\x99s.  Today 78, he has built a company that \ndisseminates information in 150 countries for 25,000 clients.  His story, like those of many \nentrepreneurs who have selected Berkshire as a home for their life\xe2\x80\x99s work, is an example of what \ncan happen when a good idea, a talented individual and hard work converge. \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 In December we agreed to buy 81% of Applied Underwriters, a company that offers a combination \nof payroll services and workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation insurance to small businesses.  A majority of \nApplied\xe2\x80\x99s customers are located in California. \n \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 5</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="annotation"><a href="www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/rvbiz.pdf">www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/rvbiz.pdf</a></div>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>In 1998, though, when the company had 12 employees, it acquired an Omaha-based operation \nwith 24 employees that offered a somewhat-similar service.  Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies, who \nhave built Applied\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable business, concluded that Omaha had many advantages as an \noperational base \xe2\x80\x93 a brilliant insight, I might add \xe2\x80\x93 and today 400 of the company\xe2\x80\x99s 479 \nemployees are located here. \n \nLess than a year ago, Applied entered into a large reinsurance contract with Ajit Jain, the \nextraordinary manager of National Indemnity\xe2\x80\x99s reinsurance division.  Ajit was impressed by Sid \nand Steve, and they liked Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s method of operation.  So we decided to join forces.  We are \npleased that Sid and Steve retain 19% of Applied.  They started on a shoestring only 12 years ago, \nand it will be fun to see what they can accomplish with Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s backing. \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Last spring, MidAmerican Energy, our 80.5% owned subsidiary, agreed to buy PacifiCorp, a \nmajor electric utility serving six Western states.  An acquisition of this sort requires many \nregulatory approvals, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve now obtained these and expect to close this transaction soon. \nBerkshire will then buy $3.4 billion of MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s common stock, which MidAmerican will \nsupplement with $1.7 billion of borrowing to complete the purchase.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to earn \noutsized profits in regulated utilities, but the industry offers owners the opportunity to deploy large \nsums at fair returns \xe2\x80\x93 and therefore, it makes good sense for Berkshire.  A few years back, I said \nthat we hoped to make some very large purchases in the utility field.  Note the plural \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ll be \nlooking for more. \n</p>\n<p> \n In addition to buying these new operations, we continue to make \xe2\x80\x9cbolt-on\xe2\x80\x9d acquisitions.  Some \naren\xe2\x80\x99t so small: Shaw, our carpet operation, spent about $550 million last year on two purchases that \nfurthered its vertical integration and should improve its profit margin in the future.  XTRA and Clayton \nHomes also made value-enhancing acquisitions. \n \n Unlike many business buyers, Berkshire has no \xe2\x80\x9cexit strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d  We buy to keep.  We do, though, \nhave an entrance strategy, looking for businesses in this country or abroad that meet our six criteria and are \navailable at a price that will produce a reasonable return.  If you have a business that fits, give me a call.  \nLike a hopeful teenage girl, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be waiting by the phone. \n \nInsurance \n \n Let\xe2\x80\x99s now talk about our four sectors and start with insurance, our core business.  What counts \nhere is the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d and its cost over time. \n \n For new readers, let me explain.  \xe2\x80\x9cFloat\xe2\x80\x9d is money that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to us but that we \ntemporarily hold.  Most of our float arises because (1) premiums are paid upfront though the service we \nprovide \xe2\x80\x93 insurance protection \xe2\x80\x93 is delivered over a period that usually covers a year and; (2) loss events \nthat occur today do not always result in our immediately paying claims, because it sometimes takes many \nyears for losses to be reported (asbestos losses would be an example), negotiated and settled.  The $20 \nmillion of float that came with our 1967 entry into insurance has now increased \xe2\x80\x93 both by way of internal \ngrowth and acquisitions \xe2\x80\x93 to $49 billion. \n \n Float is wonderful \xe2\x80\x93 if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come at a high price.  Its cost is determined by underwriting \nresults, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have \nreceived.  When an insurer earns an underwriting profit \xe2\x80\x93 as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of \nthe 39 years we have been in the insurance business \xe2\x80\x93 float is better than free.  In such years, we are \nactually paid for holding other people\xe2\x80\x99s money.  For most insurers, however, life has been far more \ndifficult: In aggregate, the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss.  \nWhen that loss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so. \n \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> In 2004 our float cost us less than nothing, and I told you that we had a chance \xe2\x80\x93 absent a mega-\ncatastrophe \xe2\x80\x93 of no-cost float in 2005.  But we had the mega-cat, and as a specialist in that coverage, \nBerkshire suffered hurricane losses of $3.4 billion.  Nevertheless, our float was costless in 2005 because of \nthe superb results we had in our other insurance activities, particularly at GEICO. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Auto policies in force grew by 12.1% at GEICO, a gain increasing its market share of U.S. private \npassenger auto business from about 5.6% to about 6.1%.  Auto insurance is a big business: Each share-\npoint equates to $1.6 billion in sales. \n \n While our brand strength is not quantifiable, I believe it also grew significantly.  When Berkshire \nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its annual advertising expenditures were $31 million.  Last year we \nwere up to $502 million.  And I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to spend more. \n \n Our advertising works because we have a great story to tell: More people can save money by \ninsuring with us than is the case with any other national carrier offering policies to all comers.  (Some \nspecialized auto insurers do particularly well for applicants fitting into their niches; also, because our \nnational competitors use rating systems that differ from ours, they will sometimes beat our price.)  Last \nyear, we achieved by far the highest conversion rate \xe2\x80\x93 the percentage of internet and phone quotes turned \ninto sales \xe2\x80\x93 in our history.  This is powerful evidence that our prices are more attractive relative to the \ncompetition than ever before.  Test us by going to GEICO.com or by calling 800-847-7536.  Be sure to \nindicate you are a shareholder because that fact will often qualify you for a discount. \n \n I told you last year about GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s entry into New Jersey in August, 2004.  Drivers in that state \nlove us.  Our retention rate there for new policyholders is running higher than in any other state, and by \nsometime in 2007, GEICO is likely to become the third largest auto insurer in New Jersey.  There, as \nelsewhere, our low costs allow low prices that lead to steady gains in profitable business. \n \n That simple formula immediately impressed me 55 years ago when I first discovered GEICO.  \nIndeed, at age 21, I wrote an article about the company \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s reproduced on page 24 \xe2\x80\x93 when its market \nvalue was $7 million.  As you can see, I called GEICO \xe2\x80\x9cThe Security I Like Best.\xe2\x80\x9d  And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I still \ncall it.  \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n We have major reinsurance operations at General Re and National Indemnity.  The former is run \nby Joe Brandon and Tad Montross, the latter by Ajit Jain.  Both units performed well in 2005 considering \nthe extraordinary hurricane losses that battered the industry. \n \n It\xe2\x80\x99s an open question whether atmospheric, oceanic or other causal factors have dramatically \nchanged the frequency or intensity of hurricanes.  Recent experience is worrisome.  We know, for instance, \nthat in the 100 years before 2004, about 59 hurricanes of Category 3 strength, or greater, hit the \nSoutheastern and Gulf Coast states, and that only three of these were Category 5s.  We further know that in \n2004 there were three Category 3 storms that hammered those areas and that these were followed by four \nmore in 2005, one of them, Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in industry history.  Moreover, there \nwere three Category 5s near the coast last year that fortunately weakened before landfall. \n \n Was this onslaught of more frequent and more intense storms merely an anomaly?  Or was it \ncaused by changes in climate, water temperature or other variables we don\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand?  And could \nthese factors be developing in a manner that will soon produce disasters dwarfing Katrina?  \n \n Joe, Ajit and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to these all-important questions.  What we do know is that \nour ignorance means we must follow the course prescribed by Pascal in his famous wager about the \nexistence of God.  As you may recall, he concluded that since he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer, his personal \ngain/loss ratio dictated an affirmative conclusion. \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> So guided, we\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded that we should now write mega-cat policies only at prices far higher \nthan prevailed last year \xe2\x80\x93 and then only with an aggregate exposure that would not cause us distress if shifts \nin some important variable produce far more costly storms in the near future.  To a lesser degree, we felt \nthis way after 2004 \xe2\x80\x93 and cut back our writings when prices didn\xe2\x80\x99t move.  Now our caution has intensified.  \nIf prices seem appropriate, however, we continue to have both the ability and the appetite to be the largest \nwriter of mega-cat coverage in the world. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Our smaller insurers, with MedPro added to the fold, delivered truly outstanding results last year.  \nHowever, what you see in the table below does not do full justice to their performance.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because we \nincreased the loss reserves of MedPro by about $125 million immediately after our purchase. \n \n No one knows with any precision what amount will be required to pay the claims we inherited.  \nMedical malpractice insurance is a \xe2\x80\x9clong-tail\xe2\x80\x9d line, meaning that claims often take many years to settle.  In \naddition, there are other losses that have occurred, but that we won\xe2\x80\x99t even hear about for some time.  One \nthing, though, we have learned \xe2\x80\x93 the hard way \xe2\x80\x93 after many years in the business: Surprises in insurance are \nfar from symmetrical.  You are lucky if you get one that is pleasant for every ten that go the other way.  \nToo often, however, insurers react to looming loss problems with optimism.  They behave like the fellow in \na switchblade fight who, after his opponent has taken a mighty swipe at his throat, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou never \ntouched me.\xe2\x80\x9d  His adversary\xe2\x80\x99s reply: \xe2\x80\x9cJust wait until you try to shake your head.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n Excluding the reserves we added for prior periods, MedPro wrote at an underwriting profit.  And \nour other primary companies, in aggregate, had an underwriting profit of $324 million on $1,270 million of \nvolume.  This is an extraordinary result, and our thanks go to Rod Eldred of Berkshire Hathaway \nHomestate Companies, John Kizer of Central States Indemnity, Tom Nerney of U. S. Liability, Don Towle \nof Kansas Bankers Surety and Don Wurster of National Indemnity. \n \n Here\xe2\x80\x99s the overall tally on our underwriting and float for each major sector of insurance: \n \n</p>\n<p> (in $ millions) \n Underwriting Profit (Loss) Yearend Float \n</p>\n<p>Insurance Operations 2005 2004 2005 2004 \nGeneral Re ....................... $(   334) $       3 $22,920 $23,120 \nB-H Reinsurance ..............

The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose \n3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) \nMidAmerican Energy, which serves 706,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; and (3) Kern River and \nNorthern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.  When our PacifiCorp \nacquisition closes, we will add 1.6 million electric customers in six Western states, with Oregon and Utah \nproviding us the most business.  This transaction will increase MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s revenues by $3.3 billion and \nits assets by $14.1 billion. \n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> 8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> The Public Utility Holding Company Act (\xe2\x80\x9cPUHCA\xe2\x80\x9d) was repealed on August 8, 2005, a \nmilestone that allowed Berkshire to convert its MidAmerican preferred stock into voting common shares on \nFebruary 9, 2006.  This conversion ended a convoluted corporate arrangement that PUHCA had forced \nupon us.  Now we have 83.4% of both the common stock and the votes at MidAmerican, which allows us \nto consolidate the company\xe2\x80\x99s income for financial accounting and tax purposes.  Our true economic \ninterest, however, is the aforementioned 80.5%, since there are options outstanding that are sure to be \nexercised within a few years and that upon exercise will dilute our ownership. \n</p>\n<p> \n Though our voting power has increased dramatically, the dynamics of our four-party ownership \nhave not changed at all.  We view MidAmerican as a partnership among Berkshire, Walter Scott, and two \nterrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel.  It\xe2\x80\x99s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will \nmake major moves only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Five years of working with Dave, \nGreg and Walter have underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have better partners. \n</p>\n<p> \n You will notice that this year we have provided you with two balance sheets, one representing our \nactual figures per GAAP on December 31, 2005 (which does not consolidate MidAmerican) and one that \nreflects the subsequent conversion of our preferred.  All future financial reports of Berkshire will include \nMidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s figures. \n</p>\n<p> \n Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the \nU.S.  And it\xe2\x80\x99s a gem.  The parent company\xe2\x80\x99s name is HomeServices of America, but our 19,200 agents \noperate through 18 locally-branded firms.  Aided by three small acquisitions, we participated in $64 billion \nof transactions last year, up 6.5% from 2004. \n</p>\n<p> \n Currently, the white-hot market in residential real estate of recent years is cooling down, and that \nshould lead to additional acquisition possibilities for us.

He does not \nowe his brilliant record to a rising tide: The manufactured-housing business has been disappointing since \nBerkshire purchased Clayton in 2003.  Industry sales have stagnated at 40-year lows, and the recent uptick \nfrom Katrina-related demand will almost certainly be short-lived.  In recent years, many industry \nparticipants have suffered losses, and only Clayton has earned significant money. \n \n In this brutal environment Clayton has bought a large amount of manufactured-housing loans from \nmajor banks that found them unprofitable and difficult to service.  Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s operating expertise and \nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s financial resources have made this an excellent business for us and one in which we are \npreeminent.  We presently service $17 billion of loans, compared to $5.4 billon at the time of our purchase.  \nMoreover, Clayton now owns $9.6 billion of its servicing portfolio, a position built up almost entirely since \nBerkshire entered the picture. \n \n To finance this portfolio, Clayton borrows money from Berkshire, which in turn borrows the same \namount publicly.  For the use of its credit, Berkshire charges Clayton a one percentage-point markup on its \nborrowing cost.  In 2005, the cost to Clayton for this arrangement was $83 million.  That amount is \nincluded in \xe2\x80\x9cOther\xe2\x80\x9d income in the table on the facing page, and Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s earnings of $416 million are after \ndeducting this payment. \n \n On the manufacturing side, Clayton has also been active.  To its original base of twenty plants, it \nfirst added twelve more in 2004 by way of the bankruptcy purchase of Oakwood, which just a few years \nearlier was one of the largest companies in the business.  Then in 2005 Clayton purchased Karsten, a four-\nplant operation that greatly strengthens Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s position on the West Coast. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Long ago, Mark Twain said: \xe2\x80\x9cA man who tries to carry a cat home by its tail will learn a lesson \nthat can be learned in no other way.\xe2\x80\x9d  If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a derivatives \nbusiness.  After a few days, he would opt for cats. \n \n We lost $104 million pre-tax last year in our continuing attempt to exit Gen Re\xe2\x80\x99s derivative \noperation.  Our aggregate losses since we began this endeavor total $404 million. \n \n Originally we had 23,218 contracts outstanding.  By the start of 2005 we were down to 2,890.  \nYou might expect that our losses would have been stemmed by this point, but the blood has kept flowing.  \nReducing our inventory to 741 contracts last year cost us the $104 million mentioned above. \n \n Remember that the rationale for establishing this unit in 1990 was Gen Re\xe2\x80\x99s wish to meet the \nneeds of insurance clients.  Yet one of the contracts we liquidated in 2005 had a term of 100 years!  It\xe2\x80\x99s \ndifficult to imagine what \xe2\x80\x9cneed\xe2\x80\x9d such a contract could fulfill except, perhaps, the need of a compensation-\nconscious trader to have a long-dated contract on his books.  Long contracts, or alternatively those with \nmultiple variables, are the most difficult to mark to market (the standard procedure used in accounting for \nderivatives) and provide the most opportunity for \xe2\x80\x9cimagination\xe2\x80\x9d when traders are estimating their value.  \nSmall wonder that traders promote them. \n \n A business in which huge amounts of compensation flow from assumed numbers is obviously \nfraught with danger.  When two traders execute a transaction that has several, sometimes esoteric, variables \nand a far-off settlement date, their respective firms must subsequently value these contracts whenever they \ncalculate their earnings.  A given contract may be valued at one price by Firm A and at another by Firm B.  \nYou can bet that the valuation differences \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99m personally familiar with several that were huge \xe2\x80\x93 tend \nto be tilted in a direction favoring higher earnings at each firm.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a strange world in which two parties \ncan carry out a paper transaction that each can promptly report as profitable. \n \n I dwell on our experience in derivatives each year for two reasons.  One is personal and \nunpleasant.  The hard fact is that I have cost you a lot of money by not moving immediately to close down \n</p>\n<p> 10</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Gen Re\xe2\x80\x99s trading operation.  Both Charlie and I knew at the time of the Gen Re purchase that it was a \nproblem and told its management that we wanted to exit the business.  It was my responsibility to make \nsure that happened.  Rather than address the situation head on, however, I wasted several years while we \nattempted to sell the operation.  That was a doomed endeavor because no realistic solution could have \nextricated us from the maze of liabilities that was going to exist for decades.  Our obligations were \nparticularly worrisome because their potential to explode could not be measured.  Moreover, if severe \ntrouble occurred, we knew it was likely to correlate with problems elsewhere in financial markets. \n \n So I failed in my attempt to exit painlessly, and in the meantime more trades were put on the \nbooks.  Fault me for dithering.  (Charlie calls it thumb-sucking.)  When a problem exists, whether in \npersonnel or in business operations, the time to act is now. \n \n The second reason I regularly describe our problems in this area lies in the hope that our \nexperiences may prove instructive for managers, auditors and regulators.  In a sense, we are a canary in this \nbusiness coal mine and should sing a song of warning as we expire.  The number and value of derivative \ncontracts outstanding in the world continues to mushroom and is now a multiple of what existed in 1998, \nthe last time that financial chaos erupted. \n \n Our experience should be particularly sobering because we were a better-than-average candidate \nto exit gracefully.  Gen Re was a relatively minor operator in the derivatives field.  It has had the good \nfortune to unwind its supposedly liquid positions in a benign market, all the while free of financial or other \npressures that might have forced it to conduct the liquidation in a less-than-efficient manner.  Our \naccounting in the past was conventional and actually thought to be conservative.  Additionally, we know of \nno bad behavior by anyone involved. \n \n It could be a different story for others in the future.  Imagine, if you will, one or more firms \n(troubles often spread) with positions that are many multiples of ours attempting to liquidate in chaotic \nmarkets and under extreme, and well-publicized, pressures.  This is a scenario to which much attention \nshould be given now rather than after the fact.  The time to have considered \xe2\x80\x93 and improved \xe2\x80\x93 the reliability \nof New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99 levees was before Katrina. \n \n When we finally wind up Gen Re Securities, my feelings about its departure will be akin to those \nexpressed in a country song, \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife ran away with my best friend, and I sure miss him a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n</p>\n<p> Below are the results of our various finance and financial products activities: \n \n \n</p>\n<p>(in $ millions) \nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities \n</p>\n<p> 2005 2004 2005 2004 \nTrading  \xe2\x80\x93 ordinary income ............................  $    200 $   264 $1,061 $5,751 \nGen Re Securities (loss) .................................

You \nknow, of course, of our leadership position in men\xe2\x80\x99s and boys\xe2\x80\x99 underwear, in which we account \nfor about 48.7% of the sales recorded by mass-marketers (Wal-Mart, Target, etc.).  That\xe2\x80\x99s up from \n44.2% in 2002, when we acquired the company.

Willey continues to overwhelm seven-day competitors as \nwe roll out stores in new markets.  The Boise store, about which I was such a skeptic a few years \nback, had a 21% gain in 2005, coming off a 10% gain in 2004.  Our new Reno store, opened in \nNovember, broke out of the gate fast with sales that exceeded Boise\xe2\x80\x99s early pace, and we will \nbegin business in Sacramento in June.

I said last year that this business would earn \nmoney in 2005 \xe2\x80\x93 and I was dead wrong. \n \nOur European operation, it should be noted, showed both excellent growth and a reduced loss.  \nCustomer contracts there increased by 37%.  We are the only fractional-ownership operation of \nany size in Europe, and our now-pervasive presence there is a key factor in making NetJets the \nworldwide leader in this industry. \n</p>\n<p> \nDespite a large increase in customers, however, our U.S. operation dipped far into the red.  Its \nefficiency fell, and costs soared.  We believe that our three largest competitors suffered similar \nproblems, but each is owned by aircraft manufacturers that may think differently than we do about \nthe necessity of making adequate profits.  The combined value of the fleets managed by these \nthree competitors, in any case, continues to be less valuable than the fleet that we operate. \n</p>\n<p> \nRich Santulli, one of the most dynamic managers I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met, will solve our revenue/expense \nproblem.

But if we treat customers with indifference or tolerate bloat, our \nbusinesses will wither.  On a daily basis, the effects of our actions are imperceptible; cumulatively, though, \ntheir consequences are enormous. \n \n When our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable \nactions, we describe the phenomenon as \xe2\x80\x9cwidening the moat.\xe2\x80\x9d  And doing that is essential if we are to have \nthe kind of business we want a decade or two from now.  We always, of course, hope to earn more money \nin the short-term.  But when short-term and long-term conflict, widening the moat must take precedence.  If \na management makes bad decisions in order to hit short-term earnings targets, and consequently gets \nbehind the eight-ball in terms of costs, customer satisfaction or brand strength, no amount of subsequent \nbrilliance will overcome the damage that has been inflicted.  Take a look at the dilemmas of managers in \nthe auto and airline industries today as they struggle with the huge problems handed them by their \npredecessors.  Charlie is fond of quoting Ben Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure.\xe2\x80\x9d  But sometimes no amount of cure will overcome the mistakes of the past. \n</p>\n<p> \n Our managers focus on moat-widening \xe2\x80\x93 and are brilliant at it.  Quite simply, they are passionate \nabout their businesses.  Usually, they were running those long before we came along; our only function \nsince has been to stay out of the way.

This bookkeeping entry, dictated by GAAP, is meaningless from an \neconomic standpoint, and you should ignore it when you are evaluating Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s 2005 earnings.  We \ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to sell our Gillette shares before the merger; we don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to sell our P&amp;G shares now; and \nwe incurred no tax when the merger took place. \n \n It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to overemphasize the importance of who is CEO of a company.  Before Jim Kilts arrived \nat Gillette in 2001, the company was struggling, having particularly suffered from capital-allocation \nblunders.  In the major example, Gillette\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of Duracell cost Gillette shareholders billions of \ndollars, a loss never made visible by conventional accounting.  Quite simply, what Gillette received in \nbusiness value in this acquisition was not equivalent to what it gave up.  (Amazingly, this most \nfundamental of yardsticks is almost always ignored by both managements and their investment bankers \nwhen acquisitions are under discussion.) \n \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 15</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Upon taking office at Gillette, Jim quickly instilled fiscal discipline, tightened operations and \nenergized marketing, moves that dramatically increased the intrinsic value of the company.  Gillette\xe2\x80\x99s \nmerger with P&amp;G then expanded the potential of both companies.  For his accomplishments, Jim was paid \nvery well \xe2\x80\x93 but he earned every penny.  (This is no academic evaluation: As a 9.7% owner of Gillette, \nBerkshire in effect paid that proportion of his compensation.)  Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to overpay the truly \nextraordinary CEO of a giant enterprise.  But this species is rare. \n \n Too often, executive compensation in the U.S. is ridiculously out of line with performance.  That \nwon\xe2\x80\x99t change, moreover, because the deck is stacked against investors when it comes to the CEO\xe2\x80\x99s pay.  \nThe upshot is that a mediocre-or-worse CEO \xe2\x80\x93 aided by his handpicked VP of human relations and a \nconsultant from the ever-accommodating firm of Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo \xe2\x80\x93 all too often receives gobs \nof money from an ill-designed compensation arrangement. \n \n Take, for instance, ten year, fixed-price options (and who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?).  If Fred Futile, CEO of \nStagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of these \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s say enough to give him an option on 1% of the company \xe2\x80\x93 \nhis self-interest is clear: He should skip dividends entirely and instead use all of the company\xe2\x80\x99s earnings to \nrepurchase stock. \n \n Let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that under Fred\xe2\x80\x99s leadership Stagnant lives up to its name.  In each of the ten years \nafter the option grant, it earns $1 billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to $10 per share \non the 100 million shares then outstanding.  Fred eschews dividends and regularly uses all earnings to \nrepurchase shares.  If the stock constantly sells at ten times earnings per share, it will have appreciated \n158% by the end of the option period.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because repurchases would reduce the number of shares to \n38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share would thereby increase to $25.80.  Simply by withholding \nearnings from owners, Fred gets very rich, making a cool $158 million, despite the business itself \nimproving not at all.  Astonishingly, Fred could have made more than $100 million if Stagnant\xe2\x80\x99s earnings \nhad declined by 20% during the ten-year period. \n \n Fred can also get a splendid result for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings \nhe withholds from shareholders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions.  Even if these \ninitiatives deliver a paltry 5% return, Fred will still make a bundle.  Specifically \xe2\x80\x93 with Stagnant\xe2\x80\x99s p/e ratio \nremaining unchanged at ten \xe2\x80\x93 Fred\xe2\x80\x99s option will deliver him $63 million.  Meanwhile, his shareholders will \nwonder what happened to the \xe2\x80\x9calignment of interests\xe2\x80\x9d that was supposed to occur when Fred was issued \noptions. \n \n A \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d dividend policy, of course \xe2\x80\x93 one-third of earnings paid out, for example \xe2\x80\x93 produces \nless extreme results but still can provide lush rewards for managers who achieve nothing. \n \n CEOs understand this math and know that every dime paid out in dividends reduces the value of \nall outstanding options.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve never, however, seen this manager-owner conflict referenced in proxy \nmaterials that request approval of a fixed-priced option plan.  Though CEOs invariably preach internally \nthat capital comes at a cost, they somehow forget to tell shareholders that fixed-price options give them \ncapital that is free.  \n \n It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way: It\xe2\x80\x99s child\xe2\x80\x99s play for a board to design options that give effect to the \nautomatic build-up in value that occurs when earnings are retained.  But \xe2\x80\x93 surprise, surprise \xe2\x80\x93 options of \nthat kind are almost never issued.  Indeed, the very thought of options with strike prices that are adjusted \nfor retained earnings seems foreign to compensation \xe2\x80\x9cexperts,\xe2\x80\x9d who are nevertheless encyclopedic about \nevery management-friendly plan that exists.  (\xe2\x80\x9cWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.\xe2\x80\x9d) \n \n Getting fired can produce a particularly bountiful payday for a CEO.  Indeed, he can \xe2\x80\x9cearn\xe2\x80\x9d more \nin that single day, while cleaning out his desk, than an American worker earns in a lifetime of cleaning \ntoilets.  Forget the old maxim about nothing succeeding like success: Today, in the executive suite, the all-\ntoo-prevalent rule is that nothing succeeds like failure. \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Huge severance payments, lavish perks and outsized payments for ho-hum performance often \noccur because comp committees have become slaves to comparative data.  The drill is simple: Three or so \ndirectors \xe2\x80\x93 not chosen by chance \xe2\x80\x93 are bombarded for a few hours before a board meeting with pay \nstatistics that perpetually ratchet upwards.  Additionally, the committee is told about new perks that other \nmanagers are receiving.  In this manner, outlandish \xe2\x80\x9cgoodies\xe2\x80\x9d are showered upon CEOs simply because of \na corporate version of the argument we all used when children: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mom, all the other kids have one.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nWhen comp committees follow this \xe2\x80\x9clogic,\xe2\x80\x9d yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s most egregious excess becomes today\xe2\x80\x99s baseline. \n \n Comp committees should adopt the attitude of Hank Greenberg, the Detroit slugger and a boyhood \nhero of mine.

Though I have served as a director of twenty public companies, only one CEO has put me on \nhis comp committee.  Hmmmm . . .) \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n</p>\n<p> My views on America\xe2\x80\x99s long-term problem in respect to trade imbalances, which I have laid out in \nprevious reports, remain unchanged.  My conviction, however, cost Berkshire $955 million pre-tax in 2005.  \nThat amount is included in our earnings statement, a fact that illustrates the differing ways in which GAAP \ntreats gains and losses.  When we have a long-term position in stocks or bonds, year-to-year changes in \nvalue are reflected in our balance sheet but, as long as the asset is not sold, are rarely reflected in earnings.  \nFor example, our Coca-Cola holdings went from $1 billion in value early on to $13.4 billion at yearend \n1998 and have since declined to $8.1 billion \xe2\x80\x93 with none of these moves affecting our earnings statement.  \nLong-term currency positions, however, are daily marked to market and therefore have an effect on \nearnings in every reporting period.  From the date we first entered into currency contracts, we are $2.0 \nbillion in the black. \n \n We reduced our direct position in currencies somewhat during 2005.  We partially offset this \nchange, however, by purchasing equities whose prices are denominated in a variety of foreign currencies \nand that earn a large part of their profits internationally.  Charlie and I prefer this method of acquiring non-\ndollar exposure.  That\xe2\x80\x99s largely because of changes in interest rates: As U.S. rates have risen relative to \nthose of the rest of the world, holding most foreign currencies now involves a significant negative \xe2\x80\x9ccarry.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nThe carry aspect of our direct currency position indeed cost us money in 2005 and is likely to do so again in \n2006.  In contrast, the ownership of foreign equities is likely, over time, to create a positive carry \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps \na substantial one. \n \n The underlying factors affecting the U.S. current account deficit continue to worsen, and no letup \nis in sight.  Not only did our trade deficit \xe2\x80\x93 the largest and most familiar item in the current account \xe2\x80\x93 hit an \nall-time high in 2005, but we also can expect a second item \xe2\x80\x93 the balance of investment income \xe2\x80\x93 to soon \nturn negative.  As foreigners increase their ownership of U.S. assets (or of claims against us) relative to \nU.S. investments abroad, these investors will begin earning more on their holdings than we do on ours.  \nFinally, the third component of the current account, unilateral transfers, is always negative.   \n \n The U.S., it should be emphasized, is extraordinarily rich and will get richer.  As a result, the huge \nimbalances in its current account may continue for a long time without their having noticeable deleterious \neffects on the U.S. economy or on markets.  I doubt, however, that the situation will forever remain benign.  \nEither Americans address the problem soon in a way we select, or at some point the problem will likely \naddress us in an unpleasant way of its own.  \n \n \n \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>How to Minimize Investment Returns \n \n It\xe2\x80\x99s been an easy matter for Berkshire and other owners of American equities to prosper over the \nyears.  Between December 31, 1899 and December 31, 1999, to give a really long-term example, the Dow \nrose from 66 to 11,497.  (Guess what annual growth rate is required to produce this result; the surprising \nanswer is at the end of this section.)  This huge rise came about for a simple reason: Over the century \nAmerican businesses did extraordinarily well and investors rode the wave of their prosperity.  Businesses \ncontinue to do well.  But now shareholders, through a series of self-inflicted wounds, are in a major way \ncutting the returns they will realize from their investments. \n \n The explanation of how this is happening begins with a fundamental truth: With unimportant \nexceptions, such as bankruptcies in which some of a company\xe2\x80\x99s losses are borne by creditors, the most that \nowners in aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their businesses in aggregate earn. \nTrue, by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor A may take more than his share of the pie at the \nexpense of investor B.  And, yes, all investors feel richer when stocks soar.  But an owner can exit only by \nhaving someone take his place.  If one investor sells high, another must buy high.  For owners as a whole, \nthere is simply no magic \xe2\x80\x93 no shower of money from outer space \xe2\x80\x93 that will enable them to extract wealth \nfrom their companies beyond that created by the companies themselves. \n \n Indeed, owners must earn less than their businesses earn because of \xe2\x80\x9cfrictional\xe2\x80\x9d costs.  And that\xe2\x80\x99s \nmy point: These costs are now being incurred in amounts that will cause shareholders to earn far less than \nthey historically have. \n \n To understand how this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all American corporations \nare, and always will be, owned by a single family.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll call them the Gotrocks.  After paying taxes on \ndividends, this family \xe2\x80\x93 generation after generation \xe2\x80\x93 becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its \ncompanies.  Today that amount is about $700 billion annually.  Naturally, the family spends some of these \ndollars.  But the portion it saves steadily compounds for its benefit.  In the Gotrocks household everyone \ngrows wealthier at the same pace, and all is harmonious. \n \n But let\xe2\x80\x99s now assume that a few fast-talking Helpers approach the family and persuade each of its \nmembers to try to outsmart his relatives by buying certain of their holdings and selling them certain others. \nThe Helpers \xe2\x80\x93 for a fee, of course \xe2\x80\x93 obligingly agree to handle these transactions.  The Gotrocks still own \nall of corporate America; the trades just rearrange who owns what.  So the family\xe2\x80\x99s annual gain in wealth \ndiminishes, equaling the earnings of American business minus commissions paid.  The more that family \nmembers trade, the smaller their share of the pie and the larger the slice received by the Helpers.  This fact \nis not lost upon these broker-Helpers: Activity is their friend and, in a wide variety of ways, they urge it on. \n \n After a while, most of the family members realize that they are not doing so well at this new \xe2\x80\x9cbeat-\nmy-brother\xe2\x80\x9d game.  Enter another set of Helpers.  These newcomers explain to each member of the \nGotrocks clan that by himself he\xe2\x80\x99ll never outsmart the rest of the family.  The suggested cure: \xe2\x80\x9cHire a \nmanager \xe2\x80\x93 yes, us \xe2\x80\x93 and get the job done professionally.\xe2\x80\x9d  These manager-Helpers continue to use the \nbroker-Helpers to execute trades; the managers may even increase their activity so as to permit the brokers \nto prosper still more.  Overall, a bigger slice of the pie now goes to the two classes of Helpers. \n \n The family\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment grows.  Each of its members is now employing professionals.  Yet \noverall, the group\xe2\x80\x99s finances have taken a turn for the worse.  The solution?  More help, of course. \n \n It arrives in the form of financial planners and institutional consultants, who weigh in to advise the \nGotrocks on selecting manager-Helpers.  The befuddled family welcomes this assistance.  By now its \nmembers know they can pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers.  Why, one might ask, \nshould they expect success in picking the right consultant?  But this question does not occur to the \nGotrocks, and the consultant-Helpers certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest it to them. \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> The Gotrocks, now supporting three classes of expensive Helpers, find that their results get worse, \nand they sink into despair.  But just as hope seems lost, a fourth group \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ll call them the hyper-Helpers \n\xe2\x80\x93 appears.  These friendly folk explain to the Gotrocks that their unsatisfactory results are occurring \nbecause the existing Helpers \xe2\x80\x93 brokers, managers, consultants \xe2\x80\x93 are not sufficiently motivated and are \nsimply going through the motions.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d the new Helpers ask, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you expect from such a bunch of \nzombies?\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n The new arrivals offer a breathtakingly simple solution: Pay more money.  Brimming with self-\nconfidence, the hyper-Helpers assert that huge contingent payments \xe2\x80\x93 in addition to stiff fixed fees \xe2\x80\x93 are \nwhat each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuver his relatives. \n \n The more observant members of the family see that some of the hyper-Helpers are really just \nmanager-Helpers wearing new uniforms, bearing sewn-on sexy names like HEDGE FUND or PRIVATE \nEQUITY.  The new Helpers, however, assure the Gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important, \nbestowing on its wearers magical powers similar to those acquired by mild-mannered Clark Kent when he \nchanged into his Superman costume.  Calmed by this explanation, the family decides to pay up. \n \n And that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are today: A record portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to \nowners \xe2\x80\x93 if they all just stayed in their rocking chairs \xe2\x80\x93 is now going to a swelling army of Helpers.  \nParticularly expensive is the recent pandemic of profit arrangements under which Helpers receive large \nportions of the winnings when they are smart or lucky, and leave family members with all of the losses \xe2\x80\x93 \nand large fixed fees to boot \xe2\x80\x93 when the Helpers are dumb or unlucky (or occasionally crooked). \n \n A sufficient number of arrangements like this \xe2\x80\x93 heads, the Helper takes much of the winnings; \ntails, the Gotrocks lose and pay dearly for the privilege of doing so \xe2\x80\x93 may make it more accurate to call the \nfamily the Hadrocks.  Today, in fact, the family\xe2\x80\x99s frictional costs of all sorts may well amount to 20% of \nthe earnings of American business.  In other words, the burden of paying Helpers may cause American \nequity investors, overall, to earn only 80% or so of what they would earn if they just sat still and listened to \nno one. \n \n Long ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius.  But Sir \nIsaac\xe2\x80\x99s talents didn\xe2\x80\x99t extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, \xe2\x80\x9cI can \ncalculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.\xe2\x80\x9d  If he had not been traumatized by this \nloss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole, \nreturns decrease as motion increases. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Here\xe2\x80\x99s the answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section: To get very specific, the \nDow increased from 65.73 to 11,497.12 in the 20th century, and that amounts to a gain of 5.3% \ncompounded annually.

To achieve an equal rate \nof gain in the 21st century, the Dow will have to rise by December 31, 2099 to \xe2\x80\x93 brace yourself \xe2\x80\x93 precisely \n2,011,011.23.

We did this in 2001 when we guaranteed $5.6 billion of bank debt to take over, in \npartnership with Leucadia, a bankrupt Finova (which held a broad range of receivables).  All of \nthat debt has been repaid.  More recently, we have borrowed to finance a widely-diversified, \npredictably-performing portfolio of manufactured-home receivables managed by Clayton.  \nAlternatively, we could \xe2\x80\x9csecuritize\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that is, sell \xe2\x80\x93 these receivables, but retain the servicing of \nthem.  If we followed this procedure, which is common in the industry, we would not show the \ndebt that we do on our balance sheet, and we would also accelerate the earnings we report.  In the \nend, however, we would earn less money.  Were market variables to change so as to favor \nsecuritization (an unlikely event), we could sell part of our portfolio and eliminate the related debt.  \nUntil then, we prefer better profits to better cosmetics. \n</p>\n<p> \n3) At MidAmerican, we have substantial debt, but it is that company\xe2\x80\x99s obligation only.  Though it \n</p>\n<p>will appear on our consolidated balance sheet, Berkshire does not guarantee it. \n \n</p>\n<p>Even so, this debt is unquestionably secure because it is serviced by MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s diversified \nstream of highly-stable utility earnings.  If there were to be some bolt from the blue that hurt one \nof MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s utility properties, earnings from the others would still be more than ample to \ncover all debt requirements.  Moreover, MidAmerican retains all of its earnings, an equity-\nbuilding practice that is rare in the utility field. \n</p>\n<p> \n From a risk standpoint, it is far safer to have earnings from ten diverse and uncorrelated utility \n</p>\n<p>operations that cover interest charges by, say, a 2:1 ratio than it is to have far greater coverage \nprovided by a single utility.  A catastrophic event can render a single utility insolvent \xe2\x80\x93 witness \nwhat Katrina did to the local electric utility in New Orleans \xe2\x80\x93 no matter how conservative its debt \npolicy.  A geographical disaster \xe2\x80\x93 say, an earthquake in a Western state \xe2\x80\x93 can\xe2\x80\x99t have the same \neffect on MidAmerican.  And even a worrier like Charlie can\xe2\x80\x99t think of an event that would \nsystemically decrease utility earnings in any major way.  Because of MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s ever-\nwidening diversity of regulated earnings, it will always utilize major amounts of debt. \n</p>\n<p> \n And that\xe2\x80\x99s about it.  We are not interested in incurring any significant debt at Berkshire for \nacquisitions or operating purposes.  Conventional business wisdom, of course, would argue that we are \nbeing too conservative and that there are added profits that could be safely earned if we injected moderate \nleverage into our balance sheet. \n \n Maybe so.  But many of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of thousands of investors have a large portion of \ntheir net worth in our stock (among them, it should be emphasized, a large number of our board and key \nmanagers) and a disaster for the company would be a disaster for them.  Moreover, there are people who \nhave been permanently injured to whom we owe insurance payments that stretch out for fifty years or \nmore.  To these and other constituencies we have promised total security, whatever comes: financial panics, \nstock-exchange closures (an extended one occurred in 1914) or even domestic nuclear, chemical or \nbiological attacks. \n \n We are quite willing to accept huge risks.  Indeed, more than any other insurer, we write high-limit \npolicies that are tied to single catastrophic events.  We also own a large investment portfolio whose market \nvalue could fall dramatically and quickly under certain conditions (as happened on October 19, 1987).  \nWhatever occurs, though, Berkshire will have the net worth, the earnings streams and the liquidity to \nhandle the problem with ease. \n \n Any other approach is dangerous.  Over the years, a number of very smart people have learned the \nhard way that a long string of impressive numbers multiplied by a single zero always equals zero.  That is \nnot an equation whose effects I would like to experience personally, and I would like even less to be \nresponsible for imposing its penalties upon others. \n \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 20</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Management Succession \n \n As owners, you are naturally concerned about whether I will insist on continuing as CEO after I \nbegin to fade and, if so, how the board will handle that problem.  You also want to know what happens if I \nshould die tonight. \n \n That second question is easy to answer.  Most of our many businesses have strong market \npositions, significant momentum, and terrific managers.  The special Berkshire culture is deeply ingrained \nthroughout our subsidiaries, and these operations won\xe2\x80\x99t miss a beat when I die. \n \n Moreover, we have three managers at Berkshire who are reasonably young and fully capable of \nbeing CEO.  Any of the three would be much better at certain management aspects of my job than I.  On \nthe minus side, none has my crossover experience that allows me to be comfortable making decisions in \neither the business arena or in investments.  That problem will be solved by having another person in the \norganization handle marketable securities.  That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting job at Berkshire, and the new CEO will \nhave no problem in hiring a talented individual to do it.  Indeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have done at GEICO for 26 \nyears, and our results have been terrific. \n \n Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s board has fully discussed each of the three CEO candidates and has unanimously \nagreed on the person who should succeed me if a replacement were needed today.  The directors stay \nupdated on this subject and could alter their view as circumstances change \xe2\x80\x93 new managerial stars may \nemerge and present ones will age.  The important point is that the directors know now \xe2\x80\x93 and will always \nknow in the future \xe2\x80\x93 exactly what they will do when the need arises. \n \n The other question that must be addressed is whether the Board will be prepared to make a change \nif that need should arise not from my death but rather from my decay, particularly if this decay is \naccompanied by my delusionally thinking that I am reaching new peaks of managerial brilliance.  That \nproblem would not be unique to me.  Charlie and I have faced this situation from time to time at \nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries.  Humans age at greatly varying rates \xe2\x80\x93 but sooner or later their talents and vigor \ndecline.  Some managers remain effective well into their 80s \xe2\x80\x93 Charlie is a wonder at 82 \xe2\x80\x93 and others \nnoticeably fade in their 60s.  When their abilities ebb, so usually do their powers of self-assessment.  \nSomeone else often needs to blow the whistle. \n \n When that time comes for me, our board will have to step up to the job.  From a financial \nstandpoint, its members are unusually motivated to do so.  I know of no other board in the country in which \nthe financial interests of directors are so completely aligned with those of shareholders.  Few boards even \ncome close.  On a personal level, however, it is extraordinarily difficult for most people to tell someone, \nparticularly a friend, that he or she is no longer capable. \n \n If I become a candidate for that message, however, our board will be doing me a favor by \ndelivering it.  Every share of Berkshire that I own is destined to go to philanthropies, and I want society to \nreap the maximum good from these gifts and bequests.  It would be a tragedy if the philanthropic potential \nof my holdings was diminished because my associates shirked their responsibility to (tenderly, I hope) \nshow me the door.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about this.  We have an outstanding group of directors, and they will \nalways do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for shareholders. \n \n And while we are on the subject, I feel terrific. \n \nThe Annual Meeting \n \n Our meeting this year will be on Saturday, May 6.  As always, the doors will open at the Qwest \nCenter at 7 a.m., and the latest Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to the \nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\xe2\x80\x99s stands) will last until 3:00.  Then, \nafter a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.  This schedule worked well last \nyear, because it let those who wanted to attend the formal session to do so, while freeing others to shop. \n \n</p>\n<p> 21</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '21': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> You certainly did your share in this respect last year.  The 194,300 square foot hall adjoining the \nmeeting area was filled with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries, and the 21,000 people who came to the \nmeeting allowed every location to rack up sales records.  Kelly Broz (ne\xc3\xa9 Muchemore), the Flo Ziegfeld of \nBerkshire, orchestrates both this magnificent shopping extravaganza and the meeting itself.  The exhibitors \nlove her, and so do I.  Kelly got married in October, and I gave her away.  She asked me how I wanted to \nbe listed in the wedding program.  I replied \xe2\x80\x9cenvious of the groom,\xe2\x80\x9d and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it went to press. \n \n This year we will showcase two Clayton homes (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that these \nhomes, priced at $79,000 and $89,000, deliver excellent value.  In fact, three shareholders came so firmly \nto that conclusion last year that they bought the $119,000 model we then showcased.  Flanking the Clayton \nhomes on the exhibition floor will be RVs from Forest River. \n \n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \nyou money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.  And while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \ncredit card.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the one I now use. \n \n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets\xc2\xae \navailable for your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  \nCome to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane. \n \n The Bookworm boutique at the Qwest broke all records last year selling Berkshire-related books.  \nAn amazing 3,500 of these were Poor Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack, the collected wisdom of my partner.  This \nmeans that a copy was sold every 9 seconds.  And for good reason: You will never find a book with more \nuseful ideas.  Word-of-mouth recommendations have caused Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s first printing of 20,500 copies to sell \nout, and we will therefore have a revised and expanded edition on sale at our meeting.  Among the other 22 \ntitles and DVDs available last year at the Bookworm, 4,597 copies were sold for $84,746.  Our \nshareholders are a bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s dream. \n \n An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. \n \n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \nwe will again be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM nine years \nago, and sales during the \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend\xe2\x80\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $27.4 million in 2005 (up 9% from \na year earlier).  I get goose bumps just thinking about this volume. \n \n To obtain the discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 4 and Monday,  \nMay 8 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even apply to \nthe products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but \nthat, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their \ncooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on \nSunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we are having a special affair for shareholders \nonly.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, eating barbeque, drinking Coke, and counting sales. \n \n Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s again will have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception \nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 5.  The second, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on \nSunday, May 7.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \n \n</p>\n<p> 22</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '22': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> We will have huge crowds at Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, \ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, May 1 through Saturday, May 13.  During \nthat period, just identify yourself as a shareholder through your meeting credentials or a brokerage \nstatement.   \n \n Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s operates on a gross margin that, even before the shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 discount, is fully twenty \npercentage points below that of its major rivals.  Last year, our shareholder-period business increased 9% \nfrom 2004, which came on top of a 73% gain the year before.  The store sold 5,000 Berkshire Monopoly \ngames \xe2\x80\x93 and then ran out.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve learned: Plenty will be in stock this year. \n \n In a tent outside of Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers \nin groups of six \xe2\x80\x93 blindfolded.  Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the \nworld\xe2\x80\x99s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They plan to keep \ntheir eyes open \xe2\x80\x93 but Bob never sorts his cards, even when playing for a national championship. \n \n Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 my favorite steakhouse \xe2\x80\x93 will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on \nSunday, May 7, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that to come to Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on \nthat day, you must have a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).   \n \n In this school year, about 35 university classes will come to Omaha for sessions with me.  I take \nalmost all \xe2\x80\x93 in aggregate, perhaps 2,000 students \xe2\x80\x93 to lunch at Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s.  And they love it.  To learn why, \ncome join us on Sunday. \n \n We will again have a special reception from 4:00 to 5:30 on Saturday afternoon for shareholders \nwho have come from outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around \nthe globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we \nenjoyed meeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from \nother than the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n</p>\n<p> Charlie and I are extraordinarily lucky.  We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw \nthat we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a \n\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who \ncontribute as much or more to our society\xe2\x80\x99s well-being.  Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in \nwhich we are helped every day in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates.  No wonder we tap-\ndance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at \nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting.  So join us on May 6th at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  \nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see you there. \n \n \nFebruary 28, 2006    Warren E. Buffett \n      Chairman of the Board \n \n \n</p>\n<p> 23</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>'}
