If a corporation such as Berkshire \nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500 \nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index \nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. </p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> \nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \n</p>\n<p> \n \nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \n \n</p>\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2007 was $12.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 11%.  Over the last 43 years (that is, since present management took \nover) book value has grown from $19 to $78,008, a rate of 21.1% compounded annually.* \n \n</p>\n<p>Overall, our 76 operating businesses did well last year.  The few that had problems were primarily \nthose linked to housing, among them our brick, carpet and real estate brokerage operations.  Their setbacks \nare minor and temporary.  Our competitive position in these businesses remains strong, and we have first-\nclass CEOs who run them right, in good times or bad. \n</p>\n<p> \nSome major financial institutions have, however, experienced staggering problems because they \n</p>\n<p>engaged in the \xe2\x80\x9cweakened lending practices\xe2\x80\x9d I described in last year\xe2\x80\x99s letter.  John Stumpf, CEO of Wells \nFargo, aptly dissected the recent behavior of many lenders: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is interesting that the industry has invented \nnew ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p> \nYou may recall a 2003 Silicon Valley bumper sticker that implored, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, God, Just One More \n</p>\n<p>Bubble.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unfortunately, this wish was promptly granted, as just about all Americans came to believe that \nhouse prices would forever rise.  That conviction made a borrower\xe2\x80\x99s income and cash equity seem \nunimportant to lenders, who shoveled out money, confident that HPA \xe2\x80\x93 house price appreciation \xe2\x80\x93 would \ncure all problems.  Today, our country is experiencing widespread pain because of that erroneous belief.  \nAs house prices fall, a huge amount of financial folly is being exposed.  You only learn who has been \nswimming naked when the tide goes out \xe2\x80\x93 and what we are witnessing at some of our largest financial \ninstitutions is an ugly sight. \n</p>\n<p> \n Turning to happier thoughts, we can report that Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s newest acquisitions of size, TTI and \nIscar, led by their CEOs, Paul Andrews and Jacob Harpaz respectively, performed magnificently in 2007.  \nIscar is as impressive a manufacturing operation as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, a view I reported last year and that was \nconfirmed by a visit I made in the fall to its extraordinary plant in Korea. \n \n Finally, our insurance business \xe2\x80\x93 the cornerstone of Berkshire \xe2\x80\x93 had an excellent year.  Part of the \nreason is that we have the best collection of insurance managers in the business \xe2\x80\x93 more about them later.  \nBut we also were very lucky in 2007, the second year in a row free of major insured catastrophes. \n \n That party is over.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a certainty that insurance-industry profit margins, including ours, will fall \nsignificantly in 2008.  Prices are down, and exposures inexorably rise.  Even if the U.S. has its third \nconsecutive catastrophe-light year, industry profit margins will probably shrink by four percentage points \nor so.  If the winds roar or the earth trembles, results could be far worse.  So be prepared for lower \ninsurance earnings during the next few years. \n \nYardsticks \n \n Berkshire has two major areas of value.  The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash \nequivalents.  At yearend these totaled $141 billion (not counting those in our finance or utility operations, \nwhich we assign to our second bucket of value). \n \n  \n *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares.  Figures for the B shares \nare 1/30th of those shown for the A. \n</p>\n<p> 3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Insurance float \xe2\x80\x93 money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to \nus \xe2\x80\x93 funds $59 billion of our investments.  This float is \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d as long as insurance underwriting breaks \neven, meaning that the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur.  Of course, insurance \nunderwriting is volatile, swinging erratically between profits and losses.  Over our entire history, however, \nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been profitable, and I expect we will average breakeven results or better in the future.  If we do that, \nour investments can be viewed as an unencumbered source of value for Berkshire shareholders. \n \n Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments \nand insurance.  These earnings are delivered by our 66 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 76.  In \nour early years, we focused on the investment side.  During the past two decades, however, we have put \never more emphasis on the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses. \n \n The following tables illustrate this shift.  In the first we tabulate per-share investments at 14-year \nintervals.  We exclude those applicable to minority interests. \n \n</p>\n<p> \nYear\n</p>\n<p>Per-Share \nInvestments\n</p>\n<p> \nYears\n</p>\n<p>Compounded Annual \nGain in Per-Share Investments\n</p>\n<p>    \n1965 $         4   \n1979 577 1965-1979 42.8% \n1993 13,961 1979-1993 25.6% \n2007 90,343 1993-2007 14.3% \n</p>\n<p> \n For the entire 42 years, our compounded annual gain in per-share investments was 27.1%.  But the \ntrend has been downward as we increasingly used our available funds to buy operating businesses. \n \n Here\xe2\x80\x99s the record on how earnings of our non-insurance businesses have grown, again on a per-\nshare basis and after applicable minority interests. \n \n</p>\n<p> \nYear\n</p>\n<p>Per Share \nPre-Tax Earnings\n</p>\n<p> \nYears\n</p>\n<p>Compounded Annual Gain in Per-\nShare Pre-Tax Earnings\n</p>\n<p>    \n1965 $      4   \n1979 18 1965-1979 11.1% \n1993 212 1979-1993 19.1% \n2007 4,093 1993-2007 23.5% \n</p>\n<p> \n For the entire period, the compounded annual gain was 17.8%, with gains accelerating as our \nfocus shifted. \n \n Though these tables may help you gain historical perspective and be useful in valuation, they are \ncompletely misleading in predicting future possibilities.  Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s past record can\xe2\x80\x99t be duplicated or \neven approached.  Our base of assets and earnings is now far too large for us to make outsized gains in the \nfuture. \n \n Charlie Munger, my partner at Berkshire, and I will continue to measure our progress by the two \nyardsticks I have just described and will regularly update you on the results.  Though we can\xe2\x80\x99t come close \nto duplicating the past, we will do our best to make sure the future is not disappointing. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n In our efforts, we will be aided enormously by the managers who have joined Berkshire.  This is \nan unusual group in several ways.  First, most of them have no financial need to work.  Many sold us their \nbusinesses for large sums and run them because they love doing so, not because they need the money.  \nNaturally they wish to be paid fairly, but money alone is not the reason they work hard and productively. \n</p>\n<p> 4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> A second, somewhat related, point about these managers is that they have exactly the job they \nwant for the rest of their working years.  At almost any other company, key managers below the top aspire \nto keep climbing the pyramid.  For them, the subsidiary or division they manage today is a way station \xe2\x80\x93 or \nso they hope.  Indeed, if they are in their present positions five years from now, they may well feel like \nfailures. \n \n Conversely, our CEOs\xe2\x80\x99 scorecards for success are not whether they obtain my job but instead are \nthe long-term performances of their businesses.  Their decisions flow from a here-today, here-forever \nmindset.  I think our rare and hard-to-replicate managerial structure gives Berkshire a real advantage. \n \nAcquisitions \n \n Though our managers may be the best, we will need large and sensible acquisitions to get the \ngrowth in operating earnings we wish.  Here, we made little progress in 2007 until very late in the year.  \nThen, on Christmas day, Charlie and I finally earned our paychecks by contracting for the largest cash \npurchase in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s history. \n \n The seeds of this transaction were planted in 1954.  That fall, only three months into a new job, I \nwas sent by my employers, Ben Graham and Jerry Newman, to a shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meeting of Rockwood \nChocolate in Brooklyn.  A young fellow had recently taken control of this company, a manufacturer of \nassorted cocoa-based items.  He had then initiated a one-of-a-kind tender, offering 80 pounds of cocoa \nbeans for each share of Rockwood stock.  I described this transaction in a section of the 1988 annual report \nthat explained arbitrage.  I also told you that Jay Pritzker \xe2\x80\x93 the young fellow mentioned above \xe2\x80\x93 was the \nbusiness genius behind this tax-efficient idea, the possibilities for which had escaped all the other experts \nwho had thought about buying Rockwood, including my bosses, Ben and Jerry. \n \n At the meeting, Jay was friendly and gave me an education on the 1954 tax code.  I came away \nvery impressed.  Thereafter, I avidly followed Jay\xe2\x80\x99s business dealings, which were many and brilliant.  His \nvalued partner was his brother, Bob, who for nearly 50 years ran Marmon Group, the home for most of the \nPritzker businesses. \n \n Jay died in 1999, and Bob retired early in 2002.  Around then, the Pritzker family decided to \ngradually sell or reorganize certain of its holdings, including Marmon, a company operating 125 \nbusinesses, managed through nine sectors.  Marmon\xe2\x80\x99s largest operation is Union Tank Car, which together \nwith a Canadian counterpart owns 94,000 rail cars that are leased to various shippers.  The original cost of \nthis fleet is $5.1 billion.  All told, Marmon has $7 billion in sales and about 20,000 employees. \n \n We will soon purchase 60% of Marmon and will acquire virtually all of the balance within six \nyears.  Our initial outlay will be $4.5 billion, and the price of our later purchases will be based on a formula \ntied to earnings.  Prior to our entry into the picture, the Pritzker family received substantial consideration \nfrom Marmon\xe2\x80\x99s distribution of cash, investments and certain businesses. \n \n This deal was done in the way Jay would have liked.  We arrived at a price using only Marmon\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial statements, employing no advisors and engaging in no nit-picking.  I knew that the business \nwould be exactly as the Pritzkers represented, and they knew that we would close on the dot, however \nchaotic financial markets might be.  During the past year, many large deals have been renegotiated or killed \nentirely.  With the Pritzkers, as with Berkshire, a deal is a deal.  \n \n Marmon\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, Frank Ptak, works closely with a long-time associate, John Nichols.  John was \nformerly the highly successful CEO of Illinois Tool Works (ITW), where he teamed with Frank to run a \nmix of industrial businesses.  Take a look at their ITW record; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be impressed. \n</p>\n<p> 5</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Byron Trott of Goldman Sachs \xe2\x80\x93 whose praises I sang in the 2003 report \xe2\x80\x93 facilitated the Marmon \ntransaction.  Byron is the rare investment banker who puts himself in his client\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.  Charlie and I trust \nhim completely. \n \n You\xe2\x80\x99ll like the code name that Goldman Sachs assigned the deal.  Marmon entered the auto \nbusiness in 1902 and exited it in 1933.  Along the way it manufactured the Wasp, a car that won the first \nIndianapolis 500 race, held in 1911.  So this deal was labeled \xe2\x80\x9cIndy 500.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n In May 2006, I spoke at a lunch at Ben Bridge, our Seattle-based jewelry chain.  The audience was \na number of its vendors, among them Dennis Ulrich, owner of a company that manufactured gold jewelry. \n \n In January 2007, Dennis called me, suggesting that with Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s support he could build a large \njewelry supplier.  We soon made a deal for his business, simultaneously purchasing a supplier of about \nequal size.  The new company, Richline Group, has since made two smaller acquisitions.  Even with those, \nRichline is far below the earnings threshold we normally require for purchases.  I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to bet, \nhowever, that Dennis \xe2\x80\x93 with the help of his partner, Dave Meleski \xe2\x80\x93 will build a large operation, earning \ngood returns on capital employed. \n \nBusinesses \xe2\x80\x93 The Great, the Good and the Gruesome \n \n Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at what kind of businesses turn us on.  And while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, let\xe2\x80\x99s also discuss \nwhat we wish to avoid. \n \n Charlie and I look for companies that have a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term \neconomics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag.  We like to buy the whole \nbusiness or, if management is our partner, at least 80%.  When control-type purchases of quality aren\xe2\x80\x99t \navailable, though, we are also happy to simply buy small portions of great businesses by way of stock-\nmarket purchases.  It\xe2\x80\x99s better to have a part interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone. \n \n A truly great business must have an enduring \xe2\x80\x9cmoat\xe2\x80\x9d that protects excellent returns on invested \ncapital.  The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business \n\xe2\x80\x9ccastle\xe2\x80\x9d that is earning high returns.  Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company\xe2\x80\x99s being the low-\ncost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerful world-wide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American \nExpress) is essential for sustained success.  Business history is filled with \xe2\x80\x9cRoman Candles,\xe2\x80\x9d companies \nwhose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed. \n \n Our criterion of \xe2\x80\x9cenduring\xe2\x80\x9d causes us to rule out companies in industries prone to rapid and \ncontinuous change.  Though capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccreative destruction\xe2\x80\x9d is highly beneficial for society, it precludes \ninvestment certainty.  A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all. \n \n Additionally, this criterion eliminates the business whose success depends on having a great \nmanager.  Of course, a terrific CEO is a huge asset for any enterprise, and at Berkshire we have an \nabundance of these managers.  Their abilities have created billions of dollars of value that would never \nhave materialized if typical CEOs had been running their businesses.  \n \n But if a business requires a superstar to produce great results, the business itself cannot be deemed \ngreat.  A medical partnership led by your area\xe2\x80\x99s premier brain surgeon may enjoy outsized and growing \nearnings, but that tells little about its future.  The partnership\xe2\x80\x99s moat will go when the surgeon goes.  You \ncan count, though, on the moat of the Mayo Clinic to endure, even though you can\xe2\x80\x99t name its CEO. \n \n</p>\n<p> 6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry is what we seek in a business.  If that comes \nwith rapid organic growth, great.  But even without organic growth, such a business is rewarding.  We will  \nsimply take the lush earnings of the business and use them to buy similar businesses elsewhere.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no  \nrule that you have to invest money where you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned it.  Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s often a mistake to do so: Truly \ngreat businesses, earning huge returns on tangible assets, can\xe2\x80\x99t for any extended period reinvest a large \nportion of their earnings internally at high rates of return. \n \n Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the prototype of a dream business, our own See\xe2\x80\x99s Candy.  The boxed-chocolates \nindustry in which it operates is unexciting: Per-capita consumption in the U.S. is extremely low and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \ngrow.  Many once-important brands have disappeared, and only three companies have earned more than \ntoken profits over the last forty years.  Indeed, I believe that See\xe2\x80\x99s, though it obtains the bulk of its revenues \nfrom only a few states, accounts for nearly half of the entire industry\xe2\x80\x99s earnings. \n \n At See\xe2\x80\x99s, annual sales were 16 million pounds of candy when Blue Chip Stamps purchased the \ncompany in 1972.  (Charlie and I controlled Blue Chip at the time and later merged it into Berkshire.)  Last \nyear See\xe2\x80\x99s sold 31 million pounds, a growth rate of only 2% annually.  Yet its durable competitive \nadvantage, built by the See\xe2\x80\x99s family over a 50-year period, and strengthened subsequently by Chuck \nHuggins and Brad Kinstler, has produced extraordinary results for Berkshire. \n \n We bought See\xe2\x80\x99s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less \nthan $5 million.  The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million.  (Modest seasonal debt \nwas also needed for a few months each year.)  Consequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on \ninvested capital.  Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations.  First, the product was \nsold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable.  Second, the production and distribution cycle was \nshort, which minimized inventories. \n \n Last year See\xe2\x80\x99s sales were $383 million, and pre-tax profits were $82 million.  The capital now \nrequired to run the business is $40 million.  This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since \n1972 to handle the modest physical growth \xe2\x80\x93 and somewhat immodest financial growth \xe2\x80\x93 of the business.  \nIn the meantime pre-tax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion.  All of that, except for the $32 million, has \nbeen sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip).  After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we \nhave used the rest to buy other attractive businesses.  Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led \nto six billion humans, See\xe2\x80\x99s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us.  (The biblical command \nto \xe2\x80\x9cbe fruitful and multiply\xe2\x80\x9d is one we take seriously at Berkshire.) \n \n There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many See\xe2\x80\x99s in Corporate America.  Typically, companies that increase their earnings \nfrom $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their \ngrowth.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because growing businesses have both working capital needs that increase in proportion to \nsales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments. \n \n A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a \nsatisfactory investment.  There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 \nmillion pre-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets.  But that equation for the owner is vastly different \nfrom the See\xe2\x80\x99s situation.  It\xe2\x80\x99s far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no \nmajor capital requirements.  Ask Microsoft or Google. \n \n One example of good, but far from sensational, business economics is our own FlightSafety.  This \ncompany delivers benefits to its customers that are the equal of those delivered by any business that I know \nof.  It also possesses a durable competitive advantage: Going to any other flight-training provider than the \nbest is like taking the low bid on a surgical procedure. \n</p>\n<p> 7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Nevertheless, this business requires a significant reinvestment of earnings if it is to grow.  When \nwe purchased FlightSafety in 1996, its pre-tax operating earnings were $111 million, and its net investment \nin fixed assets was $570 million.  Since our purchase, depreciation charges have totaled $923 million.  But \ncapital expenditures have totaled $1.635 billion, most of that for simulators to match the new airplane \nmodels that are constantly being introduced.  (A simulator can cost us more than $12 million, and we have \n273 of them.)  Our fixed assets, after depreciation, now amount to $1.079 billion.  Pre-tax operating \nearnings in 2007 were $270 million, a gain of $159 million since 1996.  That gain gave us a good, but far \nfrom See\xe2\x80\x99s-like, return on our incremental investment of $509 million. \n \n Consequently, if measured only by economic returns, FlightSafety is an excellent but not \nextraordinary business.  Its put-up-more-to-earn-more experience is that faced by most corporations.  For \nexample, our large investment in regulated utilities falls squarely in this category.  We will earn \nconsiderably more money in this business ten years from now, but we will invest many billions to make it. \n \n Now let\xe2\x80\x99s move to the gruesome.  The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires \nsignificant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money.  Think airlines.  Here a \ndurable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers.  Indeed, if a \nfarsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by \nshooting Orville down. \n \n The airline industry\xe2\x80\x99s demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable.  Investors \nhave poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.  \nAnd I, to my shame, participated in this foolishness when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in \n1989.  As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred \ndividend was no longer being paid.  But we then got very lucky.  In one of the recurrent, but always \nmisguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actually able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain.  \nIn the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt.  Twice. \n \n To sum up, think of three types of \xe2\x80\x9csavings accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d  The great one pays an extraordinarily high \ninterest rate that will rise as the years pass.  The good one pays an attractive rate of interest that will be \nearned also on deposits that are added.  Finally, the gruesome account both pays an inadequate interest rate \nand requires you to keep adding money at those disappointing returns. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n And now it\xe2\x80\x99s confession time.  It should be noted that no consultant, board of directors or \ninvestment banker pushed me into the mistakes I will describe.  In tennis parlance, they were all unforced \nerrors. \n</p>\n<p> \n To begin with, I almost blew the See\xe2\x80\x99s purchase.  The seller was asking $30 million, and I was \nadamant about not going above $25 million.  Fortunately, he caved.  Otherwise I would have balked, and \nthat $1.35 billion would have gone to somebody else. \n</p>\n<p> \n About the time of the See\xe2\x80\x99s purchase, Tom Murphy, then running Capital Cities Broadcasting, \ncalled and offered me the Dallas-Fort Worth NBC station for $35 million.  The station came with the Fort \nWorth paper that Capital Cities was buying, and under the \xe2\x80\x9ccross-ownership\xe2\x80\x9d rules Murph had to divest it.  \nI knew that TV stations were See\xe2\x80\x99s-like businesses that required virtually no capital investment and had \nexcellent prospects for growth.  They were simple to run and showered cash on their owners. \n</p>\n<p> \n Moreover, Murph, then as now, was a close friend, a man I admired as an extraordinary manager \nand outstanding human being.  He knew the television business forward and backward and would not have \ncalled me unless he felt a purchase was certain to work.  In effect Murph whispered \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d into my ear.  But \nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen. \n \n</p>\n<p> 8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> In 2006, the station earned $73 million pre-tax, bringing its total earnings since I turned down the \ndeal to at least $1 billion \xe2\x80\x93 almost all available to its owner for other purposes.  Moreover, the property now \nhas a capital value of about $800 million.  Why did I say \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d?  The only explanation is that my brain had \ngone on vacation and forgot to notify me.  (My behavior resembled that of a politician Molly Ivins once \ndescribed: \xe2\x80\x9cIf his I.Q. was any lower, you would have to water him twice a day.\xe2\x80\x9d) \n \n Finally, I made an even worse mistake when I said \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to Dexter, a shoe business I bought in \n1993 for $433 million in Berkshire stock (25,203 shares of A).  What I had assessed as durable competitive \nadvantage vanished within a few years.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning: By using Berkshire stock, I \ncompounded this error hugely.  That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but \nrather $3.5 billion.  In essence, I gave away 1.6% of a wonderful business \xe2\x80\x93 one now valued at $220 billion \n\xe2\x80\x93 to buy a worthless business. \n \n To date, Dexter is the worst deal that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made.  But I\xe2\x80\x99ll make more mistakes in the future \xe2\x80\x93 you \ncan bet on that.  A line from Bobby Bare\xe2\x80\x99s country song explains what too often happens with acquisitions: \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never gone to bed with an ugly woman, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve sure woke up with a few.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the four major operating sectors of Berkshire.  Each sector has vastly different \nbalance sheet and income account characteristics.  Therefore, lumping them together impedes analysis.  So \nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. \n \nInsurance \n \n The best anecdote I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard during the current presidential campaign came from Mitt Romney, \nwho asked his wife, Ann, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were young, did you ever in your wildest dreams think I might be \npresident?\xe2\x80\x9d  To which she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHoney, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t in my wildest dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n When we first entered the property/casualty insurance business in 1967, my wildest dreams did \nnot envision our current operation.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s how we did in the first five years after purchasing National \nIndemnity: \n \n</p>\n<p>Year Underwriting Profit (Loss) Float\n                              (in millions) \n1967 $  0.4 $18.5 \n1968 0.6 21.3 \n1969 0.1 25.4 \n1970 (0.4) 39.4 \n1971 1.4 65.6 \n</p>\n<p> \n To put it charitably, we were a slow starter.  But things changed.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s the record of the last five \nyears: \n \n</p>\n<p>Year Underwriting Profit (Loss) Float\n                               (in millions) \n2003 $1,718 $44,220 \n2004 1,551 46,094 \n2005 53 49,287 \n2006 3,838 50,887 \n2007 3,374 58,698 \n</p>\n<p> \n This metamorphosis has been accomplished by some extraordinary managers.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at what \neach has achieved. \n</p>\n<p> 9</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> \n\xe2\x80\xa2 GEICO possesses the widest moat of any of our insurers, one carefully protected and expanded by \n</p>\n<p>Tony Nicely, its CEO.  Last year \xe2\x80\x93 again \xe2\x80\x93 GEICO had the best growth record among major auto \ninsurers, increasing its market share to 7.2%.  When Berkshire acquired control in 1995, that share \nwas 2.5%.  Not coincidentally, annual ad expenditures by GEICO have increased from $31 million \nto $751 million during the same period. \n</p>\n<p> \nTony, now 64, joined GEICO at 18.  Every day since, he has been passionate about the company \xe2\x80\x93 \nproud of how it could both save money for its customers and provide growth opportunities for its \nassociates.  Even now, with sales at $12 billion, Tony feels GEICO is just getting started.  So do I. \n \nHere\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence.  In the last three years, GEICO has increased its share of the motorcycle \nmarket from 2.1% to 6%.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve also recently begun writing policies on ATVs and RVs.  And in \nNovember we wrote our first commercial auto policy.  GEICO and National Indemnity are \nworking together in the commercial field, and early results are very encouraging. \n \nEven in aggregate, these lines will remain a small fraction of our personal auto volume.  \nNevertheless, they should deliver a growing stream of underwriting profits and float. \n</p>\n<p> \n\xe2\x80\xa2 General Re, our international reinsurer, is by far our largest source of \xe2\x80\x9chome-grown\xe2\x80\x9d float \xe2\x80\x93 $23 \n</p>\n<p>billion at yearend.  This operation is now a huge asset for Berkshire.  Our ownership, however, \nhad a shaky start. \n</p>\n<p> \nFor decades, General Re was the Tiffany of reinsurers, admired by all for its underwriting skills \nand discipline.  This reputation, unfortunately, outlived its factual underpinnings, a flaw that I \ncompletely missed when I made the decision in 1998 to merge with General Re.  The General Re \nof 1998 was not operated as the General Re of 1968 or 1978. \n \nNow, thanks to Joe Brandon, General Re\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, and his partner, Tad Montross, the luster of the \ncompany has been restored.  Joe and Tad have been running the business for six years and have \nbeen doing first-class business in a first-class way, to use the words of J. P. Morgan.  They have \nrestored discipline to underwriting, reserving and the selection of clients. \n \nTheir job was made more difficult by costly and time-consuming legacy problems, both in the \nU.S. and abroad.  Despite that diversion, Joe and Tad have delivered excellent underwriting results \nwhile skillfully repositioning the company for the future. \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Since joining Berkshire in 1986, Ajit Jain has built a truly great specialty reinsurance operation \nfrom scratch.  For one-of-a-kind mammoth transactions, the world now turns to him. \n</p>\n<p> \nLast year I told you in detail about the Equitas transfer of huge, but capped, liabilities to Berkshire \nfor a single premium of $7.1 billion.  At this very early date, our experience has been good.  But \nthis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us much because it\xe2\x80\x99s just one straw in a fifty-year-or-more wind.  What we know \nfor sure, however, is that the London team who joined us, headed by Scott Moser, is first-rate and \nhas become a valuable asset for our insurance business. \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Finally, we have our smaller operations, which serve specialized segments of the insurance \nmarket.  In aggregate, these companies have performed extraordinarily well, earning above-\naverage underwriting profits and delivering valuable float for investment. \n</p>\n<p> \nLast year BoatU.S., headed by Bill Oakerson, was added to the group.  This company manages an \nassociation of about 650,000 boat owners, providing them services similar to those offered by \nAAA auto clubs to drivers.  Among the association\xe2\x80\x99s offerings is boat insurance.

It\xe2\x80\x99s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major moves only when \nwe are unanimous in thinking them wise.  Eight years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have \nunderscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have better partners. \n \n Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in \nthe U.S., HomeServices of America.  This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 18,800 \nagents.  Last year was a slow year for residential sales, and 2008 will probably be slower.  We will \ncontinue, however, to acquire quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible prices. \n \n Here are some key figures on MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s operation: \n</p>\n<p>  \n Earnings (in millions)\n 2007 2006\nU.K. utilities .......................................................................................................  $     337 $     338 \nIowa utility .........................................................................................................  412 348 \nWestern utilities (acquired March 21, 2006) .....................................................  692 356 \nPipelines .............................................................................................................  473 376 \nHomeServices.....................................................................................................  42 74 \nOther (net) ..........................................................................................................        130       245\nEarnings before corporate interest and taxes ......................................................  2,086 1,737 \nInterest, other than to Berkshire .........................................................................

Why the odd figure of $35.05?  I originally decided the business \nwas worth $35.00 per share to Berkshire.  Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m a \xe2\x80\x9cone-price\xe2\x80\x9d guy (remember See\xe2\x80\x99s?) and for several \ndays the investment bankers representing MidAmerican had no luck in getting me to increase Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \noffer.  But, finally, they caught me in a moment of weakness, and I caved, telling them I would go to \n$35.05.  With that, I explained, they could tell their client they had wrung the last nickel out of me.  At the \ntime, it hurt. \n \n Later on, in 2002, Berkshire purchased 6,700,000 shares at $60 to help finance the acquisition of \none of our pipelines.  Lastly, in 2006, when MidAmerican bought PacifiCorp, we purchased 23,268,793 \nshares at $145 per share. \n \n In 2007, MidAmerican earned $15.78 per share.  However, 77\xc2\xa2 of that was non-recurring \xe2\x80\x93 a \nreduction in deferred tax at our British utility, resulting from a lowering of the U.K. corporate tax rate.  So \ncall normalized earnings $15.01 per share.  And yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I wilted and offered the extra nickel. \n \nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \n \n Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

It\xe2\x80\x99s noteworthy also that these operations used only minor \nfinancial leverage in achieving that return.  Clearly we own some terrific businesses.  We purchased many \nof them, however, at large premiums to net worth \xe2\x80\x93 a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the \nbalance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 9.8%. \n \n</p>\n<p> 12</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> Here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Shaw, Acme Brick, Johns Manville and MiTek were all hurt in 2007 by the sharp housing \ndownturn, with their pre-tax earnings declining 27%, 41%, 38%, and 9% respectively.  Overall, \nthese companies earned $941 million pre-tax compared to $1.296 billion in 2006. \n</p>\n<p> \nLast year, Shaw, MiTek and Acme contracted for tuck-in acquisitions that will help future \nearnings.  You can be sure they will be looking for more of these. \n</p>\n<p> \n\xe2\x80\xa2 In a tough year for retailing, our standouts were See\xe2\x80\x99s, Borsheims and Nebraska Furniture Mart. \n</p>\n<p> \nTwo years ago Brad Kinstler was made CEO of See\xe2\x80\x99s.  We very seldom move managers from one \nindustry to another at Berkshire.  But we made an exception with Brad, who had previously run \nour uniform company, Fechheimer, and Cypress Insurance.  The move could not have worked out \nbetter.  In his two years, profits at See\xe2\x80\x99s have increased more than 50%. \n</p>\n<p> \nAt Borsheims, sales increased 15.1%, helped by a 27% gain during Shareholder Weekend.  Two \nyears ago, Susan Jacques suggested that we remodel and expand the store.  I was skeptical, but \nSusan was right. \n \nSusan came to Borsheims 25 years ago as a $4-an-hour saleswoman.  Though she lacked a \nmanagerial background, I did not hesitate to make her CEO in 1994.  She\xe2\x80\x99s smart, she loves the \nbusiness, and she loves her associates.  That beats having an MBA degree any time. \n \n(An aside: Charlie and I are not big fans of resumes.  Instead, we focus on brains, passion and \nintegrity.  Another of our great managers is Cathy Baron Tamraz, who has significantly increased \nBusiness Wire\xe2\x80\x99s earnings since we purchased it early in 2006.  She is an owner\xe2\x80\x99s dream.  It is \npositively dangerous to stand between Cathy and a business prospect.  Cathy, it should be noted, \nbegan her career as a cab driver.) \n \nFinally, at Nebraska Furniture Mart, earnings hit a record as our Omaha and Kansas City stores \neach had sales of about $400 million.  These, by some margin, are the two top home furnishings \nstores in the country.  In a disastrous year for many furniture retailers, sales at Kansas City \nincreased 8%, while in Omaha the gain was 6%.  \n \nCredit the remarkable Blumkin brothers, Ron and Irv, for this performance.  Both are close \npersonal friends of mine and great businessmen. \n \n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Iscar continues its wondrous ways.  Its products are small carbide cutting tools that make large and \nvery expensive machine tools more productive.  The raw material for carbide is tungsten, mined in \nChina.  For many decades, Iscar moved tungsten to Israel, where brains turned it into something \nfar more valuable.  Late in 2007, Iscar opened a large plant in Dalian, China.  In effect, we\xe2\x80\x99ve now \nmoved the brains to the tungsten.  Major opportunities for growth await Iscar.  Its management \nteam, led by Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz, and Danny Goldman, is certain to make the most of \nthem.  \n</p>\n<p> \n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight services set a record in 2007 with pre-tax earnings increasing 49% to $547 million.  \n</p>\n<p>Corporate aviation had an extraordinary year worldwide, and both of our companies \xe2\x80\x93 as runaway \nleaders in their fields \xe2\x80\x93 fully participated. \n \nFlightSafety, our pilot training business, gained 14% in revenues and 20% in pre-tax earnings.  \nWe estimate that we train about 58% of U.S. corporate pilots.  Bruce Whitman, the company\xe2\x80\x99s \nCEO, inherited this leadership position in 2003 from Al Ueltschi, the father of advanced flight \ntraining, and has proved to be a worthy successor. \n</p>\n<p> 13</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>At NetJets, the inventor of fractional-ownership of jets, we also remain the unchallenged leader.  \nWe now operate 487 planes in the U.S. and 135 in Europe, a fleet more than twice the size of that \noperated by our three major competitors combined.  Because our share of the large-cabin market is \nnear 90%, our lead in value terms is far greater. \n \nThe NetJets brand \xe2\x80\x93 with its promise of safety, service and security \xe2\x80\x93 grows stronger every year.  \nBehind this is the passion of one man, Richard Santulli.  If you were to pick someone to join you \nin a foxhole, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do better than Rich.  No matter what the obstacles, he just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop. \n \nEurope is the best example of how Rich\xe2\x80\x99s tenacity leads to success.  For the first ten years we \nmade little financial progress there, actually running up cumulative losses of $212 million.  After \nRich brought Mark Booth on board to run Europe, however, we began to gain traction.  Now we \nhave real momentum, and last year earnings tripled. \n \nIn November, our directors met at NetJets headquarters in Columbus and got a look at the \nsophisticated operation there.  It is responsible for 1,000 or so flights a day in all kinds of weather, \nwith customers expecting top-notch service.  Our directors came away impressed by the facility \nand its capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 but even more impressed by Rich and his associates. \n</p>\n<p> \nFinance and Finance Products \n \n Our major operation in this category is Clayton Homes, the largest U.S. manufacturer and \nmarketer of manufactured homes.  Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s market share hit a record 31% last year.  But industry volume \ncontinues to shrink:  Last year, manufactured home sales were 96,000, down from 131,000 in 2003, the \nyear we bought Clayton.  (At the time, it should be remembered, some commentators criticized its directors \nfor selling at a cyclical bottom.) \n \n Though Clayton earns money from both manufacturing and retailing its homes, most of its \nearnings come from an $11 billion loan portfolio, covering 300,000 borrowers.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why we include \nClayton\xe2\x80\x99s operation in this finance section.  Despite the many problems that surfaced during 2007 in real \nestate finance, the Clayton portfolio is performing well.  Delinquencies, foreclosures and losses during the \nyear were at rates similar to those we experienced in our previous years of ownership. \n \n Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s loan portfolio is financed by Berkshire.

In 2007, American \nExpress, Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble, three of our four largest holdings, increased per-share earnings \nby 12%, 14% and 14%.  The fourth, Wells Fargo, had a small decline in earnings because of the popping of \nthe real estate bubble.  Nevertheless, I believe its intrinsic value increased, even if only by a minor amount. \n \n In the strange world department, note that American Express and Wells Fargo were both \norganized by Henry Wells and William Fargo, Amex in 1850 and Wells in 1852.  P&amp;G and Coke began \nbusiness in 1837 and 1886 respectively.  Start-ups are not our game. \n \n I should emphasize that we do not measure the progress of our investments by what their market \nprices do during any given year.  Rather, we evaluate their performance by the two methods we apply to the \nbusinesses we own.  The first test is improvement in earnings, with our making due allowance for industry \nconditions.  The second test, more subjective, is whether their \xe2\x80\x9cmoats\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a metaphor for the superiorities \nthey possess that make life difficult for their competitors \xe2\x80\x93 have widened during the year.  All of the \xe2\x80\x9cbig \nfour\xe2\x80\x9d scored positively on that test. \n</p>\n<p> 15</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> We made one large sale last year.  In 2002 and 2003 Berkshire bought 1.3% of PetroChina for \n$488 million, a price that valued the entire business at about $37 billion.  Charlie and I then felt that the \ncompany was worth about $100 billion.  By 2007, two factors had materially increased its value: the price \nof oil had climbed significantly, and PetroChina\xe2\x80\x99s management had done a great job in building oil and gas \nreserves.  In the second half of last year, the market value of the company rose to $275 billion, about what \nwe thought it was worth compared to other giant oil companies.  So we sold our holdings for $4 billion. \n \n A footnote: We paid the IRS tax of $1.2 billion on our PetroChina gain.  This sum paid all costs of \nthe U.S. government \xe2\x80\x93 defense, social security, you name it \xe2\x80\x93 for about four hours. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Last year I told you that Berkshire had 62 derivative contracts that I manage.  (We also have a few \nleft in the General Re runoff book.)  Today, we have 94 of these, and they fall into two categories. \n \n First, we have written 54 contracts that require us to make payments if certain bonds that are \nincluded in various high-yield indices default.  These contracts expire at various times from 2009 to 2013.  \nAt yearend we had received $3.2 billion in premiums on these contracts; had paid $472 million in losses; \nand in the worst case (though it is extremely unlikely to occur) could be required to pay an additional $4.7 \nbillion. \n \n We are certain to make many more payments.  But I believe that on premium revenues alone, \nthese contracts will prove profitable, leaving aside what we can earn on the large sums we hold.  Our \nyearend liability for this exposure was recorded at $1.8 billion and is included in \xe2\x80\x9cDerivative Contract \nLiabilities\xe2\x80\x9d on our balance sheet. \n \n The second category of contracts involves various put options we have sold on four stock indices \n(the S&amp;P 500 plus three foreign indices).  These puts had original terms of either 15 or 20 years and were \nstruck at the market.  We have received premiums of $4.5 billion, and we recorded a liability at yearend of \n$4.6 billion.  The puts in these contracts are exercisable only at their expiration dates, which occur between \n2019 and 2027, and Berkshire will then need to make a payment only if the index in question is quoted at a \nlevel below that existing on the day that the put was written.  Again, I believe these contracts, in aggregate, \nwill be profitable and that we will, in addition, receive substantial income from our investment of the \npremiums we hold during the 15- or 20-year period. \n \n Two aspects of our derivative contracts are particularly important.  First, in all cases we hold the \nmoney, which means that we have no counterparty risk. \n \n Second, accounting rules for our derivative contracts differ from those applying to our investment \nportfolio.  In that portfolio, changes in value are applied to the net worth shown on Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s balance \nsheet, but do not affect earnings unless we sell (or write down) a holding.  Changes in the value of a \nderivative contract, however, must be applied each quarter to earnings. \n \n Thus, our derivative positions will sometimes cause large swings in reported earnings, even \nthough Charlie and I might believe the intrinsic value of these positions has changed little.  He and I will \nnot be bothered by these swings \xe2\x80\x93 even though they could easily amount to $1 billion or more in a quarter \xe2\x80\x93 \nand we hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t be either.  You will recall that in our catastrophe insurance business, we are always \nready to trade increased volatility in reported earnings in the short run for greater gains in net worth in the \nlong run.  That is our philosophy in derivatives as well. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n The U.S. dollar weakened further in 2007 against major currencies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no mystery why: \nAmericans like buying products made elsewhere more than the rest of the world likes buying products \nmade in the U.S.  Inevitably, that causes America to ship about $2 billion of IOUs and assets daily to the \nrest of the world.  And over time, that puts pressure on the dollar. \n</p>\n<p> 16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> When the dollar falls, it both makes our products cheaper for foreigners to buy and their products \nmore expensive for U.S. citizens.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why a falling currency is supposed to cure a trade deficit.  Indeed, \nthe U.S. deficit has undoubtedly been tempered by the large drop in the dollar.  But ponder this:  In 2002 \nwhen the Euro averaged 94.6\xc2\xa2, our trade deficit with Germany (the fifth largest of our trading partners) was \n$36 billion, whereas in 2007, with the Euro averaging $1.37, our deficit with Germany was up to $45 \nbillion.  Similarly, the Canadian dollar averaged 64\xc2\xa2 in 2002 and 93\xc2\xa2 in 2007.  Yet our trade deficit with \nCanada rose as well, from $50 billion in 2002 to $64 billion in 2007.  So far, at least, a plunging dollar has \nnot done much to bring our trade activity into balance. \n \n There\xe2\x80\x99s been much talk recently of sovereign wealth funds and how they are buying large pieces \nof American businesses.  This is our doing, not some nefarious plot by foreign governments.  Our trade \nequation guarantees massive foreign investment in the U.S.  When we force-feed $2 billion daily to the rest \nof the world, they must invest in something here.  Why should we complain when they choose stocks over \nbonds? \n \n Our country\xe2\x80\x99s weakening currency is not the fault of OPEC, China, etc.  Other developed \ncountries rely on imported oil and compete against Chinese imports just as we do.  In developing a sensible \ntrade policy, the U.S. should not single out countries to punish or industries to protect.  Nor should we take \nactions likely to evoke retaliatory behavior that will reduce America\xe2\x80\x99s exports, true trade that benefits both \nour country and the rest of the world. \n \n Our legislators should recognize, however, that the current imbalances are unsustainable and \nshould therefore adopt policies that will materially reduce them sooner rather than later.  Otherwise our $2 \nbillion daily of force-fed dollars to the rest of the world may produce global indigestion of an unpleasant \nsort.  (For other comments about the unsustainability of our trade deficits, see Alan Greenspan\xe2\x80\x99s comments \non November 19, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee\xe2\x80\x99s minutes of June 29, 2004, and Ben \nBernanke\xe2\x80\x99s statement on September 11, 2007.) \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n At Berkshire we held only one direct currency position during 2007.  That was in \xe2\x80\x93 hold your \nbreath \xe2\x80\x93 the Brazilian real.  Not long ago, swapping dollars for reals would have been unthinkable.  After \nall, during the past century five versions of Brazilian currency have, in effect, turned into confetti.  As has \nbeen true in many countries whose currencies have periodically withered and died, wealthy Brazilians \nsometimes stashed large sums in the U.S. to preserve their wealth. \n \n But any Brazilian who followed this apparently prudent course would have lost half his net worth \nover the past five years.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s the year-by-year record (indexed) of the real versus the dollar from the end \nof 2002 to yearend 2007: 100; 122; 133; 152; 166; 199.  Every year the real went up and the dollar fell.  \nMoreover, during much of this period the Brazilian government was actually holding down the value of the \nreal and supporting our currency by buying dollars in the market. \n \n Our direct currency positions have yielded $2.3 billion of pre-tax profits over the past five years, \nand in addition we have profited by holding bonds of U.S. companies that are denominated in other \ncurrencies.  For example, in 2001 and 2002 we purchased \xe2\x82\xac310 million Amazon.com, Inc. 6 7/8 of 2010 at \n57% of par.  At the time, Amazon bonds were priced as \xe2\x80\x9cjunk\xe2\x80\x9d credits, though they were anything but.  \n(Yes, Virginia, you can occasionally find markets that are ridiculously inefficient \xe2\x80\x93 or at least you can find \nthem anywhere except at the finance departments of some leading business schools.)   \n \n The Euro denomination of the Amazon bonds was a further, and important, attraction for us.  The \nEuro was at 95\xc2\xa2 when we bought in 2002.  Therefore, our cost in dollars came to only $169 million.  Now \nthe bonds sell at 102% of par and the Euro is worth $1.47.  In 2005 and 2006 some of our bonds were \ncalled and we received $253 million for them.  Our remaining bonds were valued at $162 million at \nyearend.  Of our $246 million of realized and unrealized gain, about $118 million is attributable to the fall \nin the dollar.  Currencies do matter. \n</p>\n<p> 17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> At Berkshire, we will attempt to further increase our stream of direct and indirect foreign earnings.  \nEven if we are successful, however, our assets and earnings will always be concentrated in the U.S.  \nDespite our country\xe2\x80\x99s many imperfections and unrelenting problems of one sort or another, America\xe2\x80\x99s rule \nof law, market-responsive economic system, and belief in meritocracy are almost certain to produce ever-\ngrowing prosperity for its citizens. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n As I have told you before, we have for some time been well-prepared for CEO succession because \nwe have three outstanding internal candidates.  The board knows exactly whom it would pick if I were to \nbecome unavailable, either because of death or diminishing abilities.  And that would still leave the board \nwith two backups. \n \n Last year I told you that we would also promptly complete a succession plan for the investment \njob at Berkshire, and we have indeed now identified four candidates who could succeed me in managing \ninvestments.  All manage substantial sums currently, and all have indicated a strong interest in coming to \nBerkshire if called.  The board knows the strengths of the four and would expect to hire one or more if the \nneed arises.  The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for \nBerkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation. \n \n (I\xe2\x80\x99ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death \xe2\x80\x93 \nabandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term \xe2\x80\x9cthinking outside the box.\xe2\x80\x9d) \n \nFanciful Figures \xe2\x80\x93 How Public Companies Juice Earnings \n \n Former Senator Alan Simpson famously said: \xe2\x80\x9cThose who travel the high road in Washington \nneed not fear heavy traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d  If he had sought truly deserted streets, however, the Senator should have \nlooked to Corporate America\xe2\x80\x99s accounting. \n \n An important referendum on which road businesses prefer occurred in 1994.  America\xe2\x80\x99s CEOs had \njust strong-armed the U.S. Senate into ordering the Financial Accounting Standards Board to shut up, by a \nvote that was 88-9.  Before that rebuke the FASB had shown the audacity \xe2\x80\x93 by unanimous agreement, no \nless \xe2\x80\x93 to tell corporate chieftains that the stock options they were being awarded represented a form of \ncompensation and that their value should be recorded as an expense. \n \n After the senators voted, the FASB \xe2\x80\x93 now educated on accounting principles by the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s 88 \ncloset CPAs \xe2\x80\x93 decreed that companies could choose between two methods of reporting on options.  The \npreferred treatment would be to expense their value, but it would also be allowable for companies to ignore \nthe expense as long as their options were issued at market value. \n \n A moment of truth had now arrived for America\xe2\x80\x99s CEOs, and their reaction was not a pretty sight.  \nDuring the next six years, exactly two of the 500 companies in the S&amp;P chose the preferred route.  CEOs of \nthe rest opted for the low road, thereby ignoring a large and obvious expense in order to report higher \n\xe2\x80\x9cearnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some of them also felt that if they opted for expensing, their directors might in future \nyears think twice before approving the mega-grants the managers longed for. \n \n It turned out that for many CEOs even the low road wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough.  Under the weakened \nrule, there remained earnings consequences if options were issued with a strike price below market value.  \nNo problem.  To avoid that bothersome rule, a number of companies surreptitiously backdated options to \nfalsely indicate that they were granted at current market prices, when in fact they were dished out at prices \nwell below market. \n \n Decades of option-accounting nonsense have now been put to rest, but other accounting choices \nremain \xe2\x80\x93 important among these the investment-return assumption a company uses in calculating pension \nexpense.  It will come as no surprise that many companies continue to choose an assumption that allows \nthem to report less-than-solid \xe2\x80\x9cearnings.\xe2\x80\x9d For the 363 companies in the S&amp;P that have pension plans, this \nassumption in 2006 averaged 8%.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the chances of that being achieved. \n</p>\n<p> 18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> The average holdings of bonds and cash for all pension funds is about 28%, and on these assets \nreturns can be expected to be no more than 5%. Higher yields, of course, are obtainable but they carry with \nthem a risk of commensurate (or greater) loss. \n \n This means that the remaining 72% of assets \xe2\x80\x93 which are mostly in equities, either held directly or \nthrough vehicles such as hedge funds or private-equity investments \xe2\x80\x93 must earn 9.2% in order for the fund \noverall to achieve the postulated 8%.  And that return must be delivered after all fees, which are now far \nhigher than they have ever been. \n \n How realistic is this expectation?  Let\xe2\x80\x99s revisit some data I mentioned two years ago: During the \n20th Century, the Dow advanced from 66 to 11,497.  This gain, though it appears huge, shrinks to 5.3% \nwhen compounded annually.  An investor who owned the Dow throughout the century would also have \nreceived generous dividends for much of the period, but only about 2% or so in the final years.  It was a \nwonderful century. \n \n Think now about this century.  For investors to merely match that 5.3% market-value gain, the \nDow \xe2\x80\x93 recently below 13,000 \xe2\x80\x93 would need to close at about 2,000,000 on December 31, 2099.  We are \nnow eight years into this century, and we have racked up less than 2,000 of the 1,988,000 Dow points the \nmarket needed to travel in this hundred years to equal the 5.3% of the last. \n \n It\xe2\x80\x99s amusing that commentators regularly hyperventilate at the prospect of the Dow crossing an \neven number of thousands, such as 14,000 or 15,000.  If they keep reacting that way, a 5.3% annual gain \nfor the century will mean they experience at least 1,986 seizures during the next 92 years.  While anything \nis possible, does anyone really believe this is the most likely outcome? \n \n Dividends continue to run about 2%.  Even if stocks were to average the 5.3% annual appreciation \nof the 1900s, the equity portion of plan assets \xe2\x80\x93 allowing for expenses of .5% \xe2\x80\x93 would produce no more \nthan 7% or so.  And .5% may well understate costs, given the presence of layers of consultants and high-\npriced managers (\xe2\x80\x9chelpers\xe2\x80\x9d). \n \n Naturally, everyone expects to be above average.  And those helpers \xe2\x80\x93 bless their hearts \xe2\x80\x93 will \ncertainly encourage their clients in this belief.  But, as a class, the helper-aided group must be below \naverage.  The reason is simple: 1) Investors, overall, will necessarily earn an average return, minus costs \nthey incur; 2) Passive and index investors, through their very inactivity, will earn that average minus costs \nthat are very low; 3) With that group earning average returns, so must the remaining group \xe2\x80\x93 the active \ninvestors.  But this group will incur high transaction, management, and advisory costs.  Therefore, the \nactive investors will have their returns diminished by a far greater percentage than will their inactive \nbrethren.  That means that the passive group \xe2\x80\x93 the \xe2\x80\x9cknow-nothings\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 must win. \n \n I should mention that people who expect to earn 10% annually from equities during this century \xe2\x80\x93 \nenvisioning that 2% of that will come from dividends and 8% from price appreciation \xe2\x80\x93 are implicitly \nforecasting a level of about 24,000,000 on the Dow by 2100.  If your adviser talks to you about double-\ndigit returns from equities, explain this math to him \xe2\x80\x93 not that it will faze him.  Many helpers are apparently \ndirect descendants of the queen in Alice in Wonderland, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve believed as many \nas six impossible things before breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d  Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while \nhe fills his pockets with fees. \n \n Some companies have pension plans in Europe as well as in the U.S. and, in their accounting, \nalmost all assume that the U.S. plans will earn more than the non-U.S. plans.  This discrepancy is puzzling: \nWhy should these companies not put their U.S. managers in charge of the non-U.S. pension assets and let \nthem work their magic on these assets as well?  I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen this puzzle explained.  But the auditors and \nactuaries who are charged with vetting the return assumptions seem to have no problem with it. \n</p>\n<p> 19</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> What is no puzzle, however, is why CEOs opt for a high investment assumption: It lets them \nreport higher earnings.  And if they are wrong, as I believe they are, the chickens won\xe2\x80\x99t come home to roost \nuntil long after they retire. \n \n After decades of pushing the envelope \xe2\x80\x93 or worse \xe2\x80\x93 in its attempt to report the highest number \npossible for current earnings, Corporate America should ease up.  It should listen to my partner, Charlie: \xe2\x80\x9cIf \nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve hit three balls out of bounds to the left, aim a little to the right on the next swing.\xe2\x80\x9d \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Whatever pension-cost surprises are in store for shareholders down the road, these jolts will be \nsurpassed many times over by those experienced by taxpayers.  Public pension promises are huge and, in \nmany cases, funding is woefully inadequate.  Because the fuse on this time bomb is long, politicians flinch \nfrom inflicting tax pain, given that problems will only become apparent long after these officials have \ndeparted.  Promises involving very early retirement \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes to those in their low 40s \xe2\x80\x93 and generous \ncost-of-living adjustments are easy for these officials to make.  In a world where people are living longer \nand inflation is certain, those promises will be anything but easy to keep. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n Having laid out the failures of an \xe2\x80\x9chonor system\xe2\x80\x9d in American accounting, I need to point out that \nthis is exactly the system existing at Berkshire for a truly huge balance-sheet item.  In every report we \nmake to you, we must guesstimate the loss reserves for our insurance units.  If our estimate is wrong, it \nmeans that both our balance sheet and our earnings statement will be wrong.  So naturally we do our best to \nmake these guesses accurate.  Nevertheless, in every report our estimate is sure to be wrong. \n \n At yearend 2007, we show an insurance liability of $56 billion that represents our guess as to what \nwe will eventually pay for all loss events that occurred before yearend (except for about $3 billion of the \nreserve that has been discounted to present value).  We know of many thousands of events and have put a \ndollar value on each that reflects what we believe we will pay, including the associated costs (such as \nattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees) that we will incur in the payment process.  In some cases, among them claims for certain \nserious injuries covered by worker\xe2\x80\x99s compensation, payments will be made for 50 years or more. \n \n We also include a large reserve for losses that occurred before yearend but that we have yet to hear \nabout.  Sometimes, the insured itself does not know that a loss has occurred.  (Think of an embezzlement \nthat remains undiscovered for years.)  We sometimes hear about losses from policies that covered our \ninsured many decades ago. \n \n A story I told you some years back illustrates our problem in accurately estimating our loss \nliability:  A fellow was on an important business trip in Europe when his sister called to tell him that their \ndad had died.  Her brother explained that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get back but said to spare nothing on the funeral, \nwhose cost he would cover.  When he returned, his sister told him that the service had been beautiful and \npresented him with bills totaling $8,000.  He paid up but a month later received a bill from the mortuary for \n$10.  He paid that, too \xe2\x80\x93 and still another $10 charge he received a month later.  When a third $10 invoice \nwas sent to him the following month, the perplexed man called his sister to ask what was going on.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d \nshe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to tell you.  We buried Dad in a rented suit.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n At our insurance companies we have an unknown, but most certainly large, number of \xe2\x80\x9crented \nsuits\xe2\x80\x9d buried around the world.  We try to estimate the bill for them accurately.  In ten or twenty years, we \nwill even be able to make a good guess as to how inaccurate our present guess is.  But even that guess will \nbe subject to surprises.  I personally believe our stated reserves are adequate, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wrong several \ntimes in the past. \n</p>\n<p> 20</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting \n \n Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 3rd.  As always, the doors will open at the \nQwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30.  At 9:30 we will go directly to \nthe question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\xe2\x80\x99s stands) will last until 3:00.  \nThen, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15.  If you decide to leave \nduring the day\xe2\x80\x99s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. \n \n The best reason to exit, of course is to shop.  We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-\nsquare-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries.  Last year, the \n27,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales.  \nBut you can do better.  (If necessary, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lock the doors.) \n \n This year we will again showcase a Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture).  You will find that this 1,550-\nsquare-foot home, priced at $69,500, delivers exceptional value.  And after you purchase the house, \nconsider also acquiring the Forest River RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. \n \n GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate.  (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \nthat given certain groups.)  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \nyou money.  For at least 50% of you, I believe we can. \n \n On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available \nfor your inspection.  Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes.  Come to \nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane.  And take all the hair gel and scissors that you wish on board with \nyou. \n \n Next, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, where you will find about 25 books and \nDVDs \xe2\x80\x93 all discounted \xe2\x80\x93 led again by Poor Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack.  Without any advertising or bookstore \nplacement, Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s book has now remarkably sold nearly 50,000 copies.  For those of you who can\xe2\x80\x99t \nmake the meeting, go to poorcharliesalmanack.com to order a copy. \n \n An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car \nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol \nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it.  Hotel \nrooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. \n \n At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \nwe will again be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d discount pricing.  We initiated this special event at NFM \neleven years ago, and sales during the \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend\xe2\x80\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30.9 million in 2007.  \nThis is more volume than most furniture stores register in a year. \n \n To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 1st and \nMonday, May 5th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential.  The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will \neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.  We \nappreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. \nto 6 p.m. on Sunday.  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a Baja Beach Bash \nfeaturing beef and chicken tacos. \n</p>\n<p> 21</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="annotation"><a href="http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/">http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/</a></div>\n</div>', '21': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p> At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail \nreception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 2nd.  The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, \nMay 4th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \n \n We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend.  For your convenience, \ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 28th through Saturday, May 10th.  \nDuring that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a \nbrokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder. \n \n On Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess \nchampion, will take on all comers \xe2\x80\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \xe2\x80\x93 in groups of six.  Nearby, \nNorman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers.  Additionally, we will have \nBob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our \nshareholders on Sunday afternoon. \n \n Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4th, and will be \nserving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Last year Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s, which seats 240, served 915 dinners on Shareholder \nSunday.  The three-day total was 2,487 including 656 T-bone steaks, the entr\xc3\xa9e preferred by the \ncognoscenti.  Please remember that to come to Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on that day, you must have a reservation.  To make \none, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before).   \n \n We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come \nfrom outside of North America.  Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and \nCharlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far.  Last year we enjoyed \nmeeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries.  Any shareholder who comes from other \nthan the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function. \n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * \n At 84 and 77, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams.  We were born in America; had \nterrific parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; \nand came equipped with a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to \nthat experienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society\xe2\x80\x99s well-being.  Moreover, \nwe have long had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful \nassociates.  Every day is exciting to us; no wonder we tap-dance to work.  But nothing is more fun for us \nthan getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting.  So join us on May 3rd at \nthe Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you there. \n \n \nFebruary 2008    Warren E.
