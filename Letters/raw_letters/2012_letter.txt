Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at\nmarket rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was previously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nresults through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated\nusing the numbers originally reported. The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-\ntax. If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its\nresults would have lagged the S&amp;P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the\nS&amp;P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the\naggregate lag to be substantial.\n</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n</p>\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n</p>\n<p>In 2012, Berkshire achieved a total gain for its shareholders of $24.1 billion. We used $1.3 billion of that\nto repurchase our stock, which left us with an increase in net worth of $22.8 billion for the year. The per-share book\nvalue of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 14.4%. Over the last 48 years (that is, since present\nmanagement took over), book value has grown from $19 to $114,214, a rate of 19.7% compounded annually.*\n</p>\n<p>A number of good things happened at Berkshire last year, but let\xe2\x80\x99s first get the bad news out of the way.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 When the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year in\nwhich we had a gain of $24.1 billion would be subpar, in terms of the comparison we present on the facing\npage.\n</p>\n<p>But subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s percentage increase in book value was less\nthan the S&amp;P\xe2\x80\x99s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). In\neight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&amp;P had a gain of 15% or more. We do better when the\nwind is in our face.\n</p>\n<p>To date, we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a five-year period of underperformance, having managed 43 times to surpass the\nS&amp;P over such a stretch. (The record is on page 103.) But the S&amp;P has now had gains in each of the last\nfour years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five-\nyear wins will end.\n</p>\n<p>One thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s results, my partner Charlie Munger, the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It\xe2\x80\x99s our job to increase intrinsic business\nvalue \xe2\x80\x93 for which we use book value as a significantly understated proxy \xe2\x80\x93 at a faster rate than the market\ngains of the S&amp;P. If we do so, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itself\noutpace the S&amp;P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, who\nthemselves can earn S&amp;P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe the gain in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value will over time likely surpass the S&amp;P returns by\na small margin. We\xe2\x80\x99re confident of that because we have some outstanding businesses, a cadre of terrific\noperating managers and a shareholder-oriented culture. Our relative performance, however, is almost\ncertain to be better when the market is down or flat. In years when the market is particularly strong, expect\nus to fall short.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 The second disappointment in 2012 was my inability to make a major acquisition. I pursued a couple of\nelephants, but came up empty-handed.\n</p>\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500th of those shown for A.\n</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Our luck, however, changed early this year. In February, we agreed to buy 50% of a holding company that\nwill own all of H. J. Heinz. The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge Paulo\nLemann, a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist.\n</p>\n<p>We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinary\nmanager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holding\ncompany. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferred\nhas two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significant\npremium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holding\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s common stock for a nominal sum.\n</p>\n<p>Our total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year. But we still\nhave plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip. So it\xe2\x80\x99s back to work; Charlie and I have again\ndonned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants.\n</p>\n<p>Now to some good news from 2012:\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 Last year I told you that BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy \xe2\x80\x93 our five most\nprofitable non-insurance companies \xe2\x80\x93 were likely to earn more than $10 billion pre-tax in 2012. They\ndelivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our\n\xe2\x80\x9cpowerhouse five\xe2\x80\x9d had aggregate earnings of $10.1 billion, about $600 million more than in 2011.\n</p>\n<p>Of this group, only MidAmerican, then earning $393 million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire eight years\nago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth,\nBNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased the\namount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire\nby the five companies has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simply\ngrowing, but rather increasing per-share results.\n</p>\n<p>Unless the U.S. economy tanks \xe2\x80\x93 which we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect \xe2\x80\x93 our powerhouse five should again deliver higher\nearnings in 2013. The five outstanding CEOs who run them will see to that.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 Though I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012, the managers of our subsidiaries did far better. We had\na record year for \xe2\x80\x9cbolt-on\xe2\x80\x9d purchases, spending about $2.3 billion for 26 companies that were melded into\nour existing businesses. These transactions were completed without Berkshire issuing any shares.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I love these acquisitions: Usually they are low-risk, burden headquarters not at all, and expand\nthe scope of our proven managers.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 Our insurance operations shot the lights out last year. While giving Berkshire $73 billion of free money to\ninvest, they also delivered a $1.6 billion underwriting gain, the tenth consecutive year of profitable\nunderwriting. This is truly having your cake and eating it too.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO led the way, continuing to gobble up market share without sacrificing underwriting discipline.\nSince 1995, when we obtained control, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s share of the personal-auto market has grown from 2.5% to\n9.7%. Premium volume meanwhile increased from $2.8 billion to $16.7 billion. Much more growth lies\nahead.\n</p>\n<p>The credit for GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary performance goes to Tony Nicely and his 27,000 associates. And to\nthat cast, we should add our Gecko. Neither rain nor storm nor gloom of night can stop him; the little lizard\njust soldiers on, telling Americans how they can save big money by going to GEICO.com.\n</p>\n<p>When I count my blessings, I count GEICO twice.\n</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our new investment managers, have proved to be smart, models of\nintegrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio management, and a perfect cultural fit. We\nhit the jackpot with these two. In 2012 each outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by double-digit margins. They left me in\nthe dust as well.\n</p>\n<p>Consequently, we have increased the funds managed by each to almost $5 billion (some of this emanating\nfrom the pension funds of our subsidiaries). Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manage\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene. You can rest easy when they\ntake over.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s yearend employment totaled a record 288,462 (see page 106 for details), up 17,604 from last\nyear. Our headquarters crew, however, remained unchanged at 24. No sense going crazy.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBig Four\xe2\x80\x9d investments \xe2\x80\x93 American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo \xe2\x80\x93 all had good\nyears. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchased\nadditional shares of Wells Fargo (our ownership now is 8.7% versus 7.6% at yearend 2011) and IBM (6.0%\nversus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage\nownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from\n13.0% to 13.7%.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Mae West had it\nright: \xe2\x80\x9cToo much of a good thing can be wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>The four companies possess marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and\nshareholder-oriented. At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a\nwonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us a\nsignificant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate.\n</p>\n<p>Going by our yearend share count, our portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cBig Four\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d 2012 earnings amounted to $3.9 billion.\nIn the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive \xe2\x80\x93 about $1.1 billion.\nBut make no mistake: The $2.8 billion of earnings we do not report is every bit as valuable to us as what\nwe record.\n</p>\n<p>The earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases \xe2\x80\x93 which enhance our share of\nfuture earnings \xe2\x80\x93 and also for funding business opportunities that are usually advantageous. Over time we\nexpect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshire\nwill increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled\n$26.7 billion at yearend).\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 There was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried \xe2\x80\x9cuncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d when faced with capital-\nallocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings and\ncash). At Berkshire, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant and\nequipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That\xe2\x80\x99s 19% more than we spent in 2011, our\nprevious high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are\nsaying. We instead heed the words from Gary Allan\xe2\x80\x99s new country song, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery Storm Runs Out of Rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>We will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expenditures\nin 2013. Opportunities abound in America.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced the\nunknown since 1776. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always exist\nwhile at other times they ignore them (usually because the recent past has been uneventful).\n</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>American business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied\nto business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game that\nis heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20th\n</p>\n<p>Century, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression and\nmany recessions. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the century\nas well.)\n</p>\n<p>Since the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out\nof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of \xe2\x80\x9cexperts,\xe2\x80\x9d or the ebb and flow of business\nactivity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.\n</p>\n<p>My own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when\nthe U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day\xe2\x80\x99s headlines told of more\nsetbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail.\n</p>\n<p>The country\xe2\x80\x99s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per\ncapita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been\nuncertain. America\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries,\ncall Berkshire. Let us unburden you.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn summary, Charlie and I hope to build per-share intrinsic value by (1) improving the earning power of our\n</p>\n<p>many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) participating in the growth\nof our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic\nvalue; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if\never, issuing Berkshire shares.\n</p>\n<p>Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy\nwill continue to play major roles in the American economy. Insurance, moreover, will always be essential for both\nbusinesses and individuals \xe2\x80\x93 and no company brings greater resources to that arena than Berkshire. As we view\nthese and other strengths, Charlie and I like your company\xe2\x80\x99s prospects.\n</p>\n<p>Intrinsic Business Value\n</p>\n<p>As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number\nis for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the\nthree elements \xe2\x80\x93 one of which was qualitative \xe2\x80\x93 that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nintrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 104-105.\n</p>\n<p>Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to\n$113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased\n15.7% to $8,085.\n</p>\n<p>Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and our\nper-share earnings figure has grown at a 20.8% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the\n42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see\ngains in both areas, but our strong emphasis will always be on building operating earnings.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nNow, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\n</p>\n<p>income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll present them\nas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\n</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s look first at insurance, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion\nover the years.\n</p>\n<p>Property-casualty (\xe2\x80\x9cP/C\xe2\x80\x9d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such\nas those arising from certain workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-\nnow, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \xe2\x80\x93 money we call \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that will eventually go to others.\nMeanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go,\nthe amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business\ngrows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\n</p>\n<p>Year Float (in $ millions)\n</p>\n<p>1970 $ 39\n1980 237\n1990 1,632\n2000 27,871\n2010 65,832\n2012 73,125\n</p>\n<p>Last year I told you that our float was likely to level off or even decline a bit in the future. Our insurance\nCEOs set out to prove me wrong and did, increasing float last year by $2.5 billion. I now expect a further increase\nin 2013. But further gains will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s float will almost certainly grow. In\nNational Indemnity\xe2\x80\x99s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts\ndownward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual \xe2\x80\x93 at the outside no\nmore than 2% in any year.\n</p>\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money\n\xe2\x80\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. That\xe2\x80\x99s like your taking out a loan and having the bank pay you interest.\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous\nin most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in\neffect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest insurer and a\nwell-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Their\nfinancials for 2012 are not yet available.) There are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry never\nceases searching for new ones.\n</p>\n<p>As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten\nconsecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will\ncontinue to underwrite profitably in most years. If we do, our float will be better than free money.\n</p>\n<p>So how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s book value is\ncalculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were\nunable to replenish it. But that\xe2\x80\x99s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving\nfund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s will be, the true value of this liability is\ndramatically less than the accounting liability.\n</p>\n<p>A partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \xe2\x80\x9cgoodwill\xe2\x80\x9d that is attributable to our insurance\ncompanies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-\ngenerating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true\nvalue. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset\ncarried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\n</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Fortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance\ngoodwill \xe2\x80\x93 what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality \xe2\x80\x93 to be\nfar in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason \xe2\x80\x93 a huge reason \xe2\x80\x93 why we believe\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n</p>\n<p>Let me emphasize once again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: There is very little \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire-quality\xe2\x80\x9d float existing in the insurance world. In 37 of the 45 years ending in\n2011, the industry\xe2\x80\x99s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry\xe2\x80\x99s\noverall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by American\nindustry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.\n</p>\n<p>A further unpleasant reality adds to the industry\xe2\x80\x99s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting\nfrom \xe2\x80\x9clegacy\xe2\x80\x9d bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvested\nduring the next few years \xe2\x80\x93 and perhaps for many years beyond that. Today\xe2\x80\x99s bond portfolios are, in effect, wasting\nassets. Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some\n</p>\n<p>extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about the major units.\n</p>\n<p>First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no\none else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most\nimportant, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are\ninappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large\ninsurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe\n\xe2\x80\x93 a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced \xe2\x80\x93 Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit\nfor the year because it has so many streams of earnings. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhile\nbe far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\n</p>\n<p>From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $35 billion and a\nsignificant cumulative underwriting profit, a feat that no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. He has\nthus added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. If you meet Ajit at the annual meeting, bow\ndeeply.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\n</p>\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both\nprospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate\npremium can\xe2\x80\x99t be obtained.\n</p>\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\xe2\x80\x99t turn their back on business\nthat is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \xe2\x80\x9cThe other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\xe2\x80\x9d\nspells trouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\n</p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\xe2\x80\x99s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be. We\nare particularly enthusiastic about General Re\xe2\x80\x99s international life reinsurance business, which has achieved\nconsistent and profitable growth since we acquired the company in 1998.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 62 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony Nicely,\n</p>\n<p>who joined the company at 18 and completed 51 years of service in 2012.\n</p>\n<p>I rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record was\nconsiderably better than is indicated by GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s GAAP underwriting profit of $680 million. Because of a change\nin accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting earnings of\n$410 million. This item had nothing to do with 2012\xe2\x80\x99s operating results, changing neither cash, revenues, expenses\nnor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value\nand the value at which we carry it on our books.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss in\nhistory. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained from\nKatrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, a\nstaggering number reflecting GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s leading market share in the New York metropolitan area.\n</p>\n<p>Last year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders\n(\xe2\x80\x9cpersistency\xe2\x80\x9d) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (\xe2\x80\x9cclosures\xe2\x80\x9d). Big dollars ride on those\ntwo factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than\n$1 billion. GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company\xe2\x80\x99s prices, they usually\nfind they can save important sums. (Give us a try at 1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com. Be sure to mention that you are a\nshareholder; that fact will usually result in a discount.)\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them\n</p>\n<p>plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies have consistently delivered\nan underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us with substantial float. Charlie and\nI treasure these companies and their managers.\n</p>\n<p>Late in 2012, we enlarged this group by acquiring Guard Insurance, a Wilkes-Barre company that writes\nworkers compensation insurance, primarily for smaller businesses. Guard\xe2\x80\x99s annual premiums total about $300\nmillion. The company has excellent prospects for growth in both its traditional business and new lines it has begun\nto offer.\n</p>\n<p>Underwriting Profit Yearend Float\n(in millions)\n</p>\n<p>Insurance Operations 2012 2011 2012 2011\n</p>\n<p>BH Reinsurance . . . . . . . . . $ 304 $(714) $34,821 $33,728\nGeneral Re . . . . . . . . . . . . . 355 144 20,128 19,714\nGEICO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 680* 576 11,578 11,169\nOther Primary . . . . . . . . . . 286 242 6,598 5,960\n</p>\n<p>$1,625 $ 248 $73,125 $70,571\n</p>\n<p>*After a $410 million charge against earnings arising from an industry-wide accounting change.\n</p>\n<p>Among large insurance operations, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s impresses me as the best in the world. It was our lucky day\nwhen, in March 1967, Jack Ringwalt sold us his two property-casualty insurers for $8.6 million.\n</p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\n</p>\n<p>We have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in\nthis letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\n</p>\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with\nthese partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact\nnot needed because each business has earning power that even under terrible conditions amply covers its interest\nrequirements. In last year\xe2\x80\x99s tepid economy, for example, BNSF\xe2\x80\x99s interest coverage was 9.6x. (Our definition of\ncoverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.)\nAt MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s recession-resistant earnings, which result from our exclusively offering an essential service, and its great\ndiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body.\n</p>\n<p>Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by\ntruck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact\nmaking BNSF the most important artery in our economy\xe2\x80\x99s circulatory system.\n</p>\n<p>BNSF also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly way, carrying a\nton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on the same job guzzle about\nfour times as much fuel.\n</p>\n<p>\xc5\xa0 MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s electric utilities serve regulated retail customers in ten states. Only one utility holding\ncompany serves more states. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: first, from a standing start nine\nyears ago, we now account for 6% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s wind generation capacity. Second, when we complete\nthree projects now under construction, we will own about 14% of U.S. solar-generation capacity.\n</p>\n<p>Projects like these require huge capital investments. Upon completion, indeed, our renewables portfolio\nwill have cost $13 billion. We relish making such commitments if they promise reasonable returns \xe2\x80\x93 and on that\nfront, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.\n</p>\n<p>Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need\nmassive investment in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital\nproviders in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. And it is in our self-interest\nto conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\n</p>\n<p>Our managers must think today of what the country will need far down the road. Energy and transportation\nprojects can take many years to come to fruition; a growing country simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to get behind the curve.\n</p>\n<p>We have been doing our part to make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Whatever you may have heard about our\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America\xe2\x80\x99s rail system has\nnever been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however, resting on our\nlaurels: BNSF will spend about $4 billion on the railroad in 2013, roughly double its depreciation charge and more\nthan any railroad has spent in a single year.\n</p>\n<p>10</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>In Matt Rose, at BNSF, and Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, we have two outstanding CEOs.

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude some\npurchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in this\nmanner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the real expenses and profits of\nthe businesses aggregated in the table.\n</p>\n<p>I won\xe2\x80\x99t explain all of the adjustments \xe2\x80\x93 some are small and arcane \xe2\x80\x93 but serious investors should\nunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value.\nWith software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as\nthe amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not real\nexpenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as\nexpenses when calculating earnings \xe2\x80\x93 even though from an investor\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint they could not be more different.\n</p>\n<p>In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $600 million for the\ncompanies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and indeed\nthat is the portion we have included in the table above \xe2\x80\x93 and the rest not. This difference has become significant\nbecause of the many acquisitions we have made.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cNon-real\xe2\x80\x9d amortization expense also looms large at some of our major investees. IBM has made many\nsmall acquisitions in recent years and now regularly reports \xe2\x80\x9cadjusted operating earnings,\xe2\x80\x9d a non-GAAP figure that\nexcludes certain purchase-accounting adjustments. Analysts focus on this number, as they should.\n</p>\n<p>12</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>A \xe2\x80\x9cnon-real\xe2\x80\x9d amortization charge at Wells Fargo, however, is not highlighted by the company and never, to\nmy knowledge, has been noted in analyst reports. The earnings that Wells Fargo reports are heavily burdened by an\n\xe2\x80\x9camortization of core deposits\xe2\x80\x9d charge, the implication being that these deposits are disappearing at a fairly rapid\nclip. Yet core deposits regularly increase. The charge last year was about $1.5 billion. In no sense, except GAAP\naccounting, is this whopping charge an expense.\n</p>\n<p>And that ends today\xe2\x80\x99s accounting lecture. Why is no one shouting \xe2\x80\x9cMore, more?\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe crowd of companies in this section sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the\n</p>\n<p>businesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25%\nafter-tax to more than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poor\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation.\n</p>\n<p>More than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price\nthan to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimes\nreverted to my old habit of bargain-hunting, with results ranging from tolerable to terrible. Fortunately, my mistakes\nhave usually occurred when I made smaller purchases. Our large acquisitions have generally worked out well and,\nin a few cases, more than well.\n</p>\n<p>Viewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ\n$22.6 billion of net tangible assets and, on that base, earned 16.3% after-tax.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive. We\nhave paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large\nfigure we show for intangible assets. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have\ndeployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of the businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value\nby a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and regulated-\nindustry segments is far greater. It is there that the huge winners reside.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMarmon provides an example of a clear and substantial gap existing between book value and intrinsic\n</p>\n<p>value. Let me explain the odd origin of this differential.\n</p>\n<p>Last year I told you that we had purchased additional shares in Marmon, raising our ownership to 80% (up\nfrom the 64% we acquired in 2008). I also told you that GAAP accounting required us to immediately record the\n2011 purchase on our books at far less than what we paid. I\xe2\x80\x99ve now had a year to think about this weird accounting\nrule, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to find an explanation that makes any sense \xe2\x80\x93 nor can Charlie or Marc Hamburg, our CFO, come\nup with one. My confusion increases when I am told that if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already owned 64%, the 16% we purchased\nin 2011 would have been entered on our books at our cost.\n</p>\n<p>In 2012 (and in early 2013, retroactive to yearend 2012) we acquired an additional 10% of Marmon and the\nsame bizarre accounting treatment was required. The $700 million write-off we immediately incurred had no effect\non earnings but did reduce book value and, therefore, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s gain in net worth.\n</p>\n<p>The cost of our recent 10% purchase implies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own.\nOur balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchase\nrepresents excellent value. If we are correct, our Marmon holding is worth at least $4.6 billion more than its\ncarrying value.\n</p>\n<p>Marmon is a diverse enterprise, comprised of about 150 companies operating in a wide variety of\nindustries. Its largest business involves the ownership of tank cars that are leased to a variety of shippers, such as oil\nand chemical companies. Marmon conducts this business through two subsidiaries, Union Tank Car in the U.S. and\nProcor in Canada.\n</p>\n<p>13</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Union Tank Car has been around a long time, having been owned by the Standard Oil Trust until that\nempire was broken up in 1911. Look for its UTLX logo on tank cars when you watch trains roll by. As a Berkshire\nshareholder, you own the cars with that insignia. When you spot a UTLX car, puff out your chest a bit and enjoy the\nsame satisfaction that John D. Rockefeller undoubtedly experienced as he viewed his fleet a century ago.\n</p>\n<p>Tank cars are owned by either shippers or lessors, not by railroads. At yearend Union Tank Car and Procor\ntogether owned 97,000 cars having a net book value of $4 billion. A new car, it should be noted, costs upwards of\n$100,000. Union Tank Car is also a major manufacturer of tank cars \xe2\x80\x93 some of them to be sold but most to be\nowned by it and leased out. Today, its order book extends well into 2014.\n</p>\n<p>At both BNSF and Marmon, we are benefitting from the resurgence of U.S. oil production. In fact, our\nrailroad is now transporting about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, roughly 10% of the total produced in the \xe2\x80\x9clower 48\xe2\x80\x9d\n(i.e. not counting Alaska and offshore). All indications are that BNSF\xe2\x80\x99s oil shipments will grow substantially in\ncoming years.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSpace precludes us from going into detail about the many other businesses in this segment. Company-\n</p>\n<p>specific information about the 2012 operations of some of the larger units appears on pages 76 to 79.\n</p>\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\n</p>\n<p>This sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well as\nClayton Homes, the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-\nowned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in Berkadia\nCommercial Mortgage.\n</p>\n<p>We include Clayton in this sector because it owns and services 332,000 mortgages, totaling $13.7 billion.\nIn large part, these loans have been made to lower and middle-income families. Nevertheless, the loans have\nperformed well throughout the housing collapse, thereby validating our conviction that a reasonable down payment\nand a sensible payments-to-income ratio will ward off outsized foreclosure losses, even during stressful times.\n</p>\n<p>Clayton also produced 25,872 manufactured homes last year, up 13.5% from 2011. That output accounted\nfor about 4.8% of all single-family residences built in the country, a share that makes Clayton America\xe2\x80\x99s number\none homebuilder.\n</p>\n<p>CORT and XTRA are leaders in their industries as well. Our expenditures for new rental equipment at\nXTRA totaled $256 million in 2012, more than double its depreciation expense. While competitors fret about\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainties, XTRA is preparing for tomorrow.\n</p>\n<p>Berkadia continues to do well.

In Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s past annual reports, every\nstock itemized in this space has been bought by me, in the sense that I made the decision to buy it for Berkshire. But\nstarting with this list, any investment made by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler \xe2\x80\x93 or a combined purchase by them \xe2\x80\x93\nthat meets the dollar threshold for the list ($1 billion this year) will be included. Above is the first such stock,\nDIRECTV, which both Todd and Ted hold in their portfolios and whose combined holdings at the end of 2012 were\nvalued at the $1.15 billion shown.\n</p>\n<p>Todd and Ted also manage the pension funds of certain Berkshire subsidiaries, while others, for regulatory\nreasons, are managed by outside advisers. We do not include holdings of the pension funds in our annual report\ntabulations, though their portfolios often overlap Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWe continue to wind down the part of our derivatives portfolio that involved the assumption by Berkshire\n</p>\n<p>of insurance-like risks. (Our electric and gas utility businesses, however, will continue to use derivatives for\noperational purposes.) New commitments would require us to post collateral and, with minor exceptions, we are\nunwilling to do that. Markets can behave in extraordinary ways, and we have no interest in exposing Berkshire to\nsome out-of-the-blue event in the financial world that might require our posting mountains of cash on a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\nnotice.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe in operating with many redundant layers of liquidity, and we avoid any sort of\nobligation that could drain our cash in a material way. That reduces our returns in 99 years out of 100. But we will\nsurvive in the 100th while many others fail. And we will sleep well in all 100.\n</p>\n<p>15</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The derivatives we have sold that provide credit protection for corporate bonds will all expire in the next\nyear. It\xe2\x80\x99s now almost certain that our profit from these contracts will approximate $1 billion pre-tax. We also\nreceived very substantial sums upfront on these derivatives, and the \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d attributable to them has averaged about\n$2 billion over their five-year lives. All told, these derivatives have provided a more-than-satisfactory result,\nespecially considering the fact that we were guaranteeing corporate credits \xe2\x80\x93 mostly of the high-yield variety \xe2\x80\x93\nthroughout the financial panic and subsequent recession.\n</p>\n<p>In our other major derivatives commitment, we sold long-term puts on four leading stock indices in the\nU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts were initiated between 2004 and 2008 and even under the worst of\ncircumstances have only minor collateral requirements. In 2010 we unwound about 10% of our exposure at a profit\nof $222 million. The remaining contracts expire between 2018 and 2026. Only the index value at expiration date\ncounts; our counterparties have no right to early termination.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire received premiums of $4.2 billion when we wrote the contracts that remain outstanding. If all of\nthese contracts had come due at yearend 2011, we would have had to pay $6.2 billion; the corresponding figure at\nyearend 2012 was $3.9 billion. With this large drop in immediate settlement liability, we reduced our GAAP\nliability at yearend 2012 to $7.5 billion from $8.5 billion at the end of 2011. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s no sure thing, Charlie and I\nbelieve it likely that the final liability will be considerably less than the amount we currently carry on our books. In\nthe meantime, we can invest the $4.2 billion of float derived from these contracts as we see fit.\n</p>\n<p>We Buy Some Newspapers . . . Newspapers?\n</p>\n<p>During the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may\npuzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that the\ncirculation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still\nholds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements for\nacquisitions.\n</p>\n<p>We can address the second point easily. Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense,\nwill buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widget\ncompany. Addressing the first point requires me to provide a more elaborate explanation, including some history.\n</p>\n<p>News, to put it simply, is what people don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they want to know. And people will seek their news\n\xe2\x80\x93 what\xe2\x80\x99s important to them \xe2\x80\x93 from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access,\nreliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of the\nnews and the person wanting it.\n</p>\n<p>Before television and the Internet, newspapers were the primary source for an incredible variety of news, a\nfact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests were\ninternational, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latest\ninformation. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth, even\nif only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost all\nof the product\xe2\x80\x99s cost, and readers rode their coattails.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect\nproviding even more \xe2\x80\x9cnews.\xe2\x80\x9d Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs or\napartments were available, what supermarkets were carrying which weekend specials, or what movies were showing\nwhere and when was far more important than the views expressed on the editorial page.\n</p>\n<p>16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>In turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they\nrequired a \xe2\x80\x9cmegaphone\xe2\x80\x9d to tell the city\xe2\x80\x99s residents why their stores should be visited today. Indeed, big department\nstores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods they\nadvertised would fly off the shelves. With no other megaphone remotely comparable to that of the newspaper, ads\nsold themselves.\n</p>\n<p>As long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary;\nwhether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nowe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions \xe2\x80\x93 nepotism and monopoly.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n</p>\n<p>Over the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that\njoined forces to operate as a single economic unit). This contraction was inevitable because most people wished to\nread and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulation\nalmost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads. This symbiotic\nprocess spelled doom for the weaker paper and became known as \xe2\x80\x9csurvival of the fattest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Now the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news\nlong before the presses begin to roll. The Internet offers extensive information about both available jobs and homes.\nTelevision bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another,\nnewspapers have therefore lost their \xe2\x80\x9cprimacy.\xe2\x80\x9d And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenues\nfrom \xe2\x80\x9chelp wanted\xe2\x80\x9d classified ads \xe2\x80\x93 long a huge source of income for newspapers \xe2\x80\x93 have plunged more than 90% in\nthe past 12 years.)\n</p>\n<p>Newspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoing on in your town \xe2\x80\x93 whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football \xe2\x80\x93 there is no substitute\nfor a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader\xe2\x80\x99s eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphs\nabout Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors will\nbe read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informational\nneeds of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents.\n</p>\n<p>Even a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. And that process has\nbeen underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers \xe2\x80\x93 including Berkshire in Buffalo \xe2\x80\x93\nhave offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen. How could\nthis lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation,\nmoreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the \xe2\x80\x9cvirtuous circle\xe2\x80\x9d of the past\nreverses.\n</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette, published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over\nthe past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. Despite\nWalter\xe2\x80\x99s powerful example, it\xe2\x80\x99s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s, have\nexplored pay arrangements. Whatever works best \xe2\x80\x93 and the answer is not yet clear \xe2\x80\x93 will be copied widely.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nCharlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound\n</p>\n<p>communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that\nsuccess will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage\nwill almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in some\nlarge towns or cities \xe2\x80\x93 while it may improve profits in the short term \xe2\x80\x93 seems certain to diminish the papers\xe2\x80\x99\nrelevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paid\nappropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet.\n</p>\n<p>17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Our confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding management group at the\nOmaha World-Herald, a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers,\nhowever, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailies\nthat endorsed a presidential candidate, 10 opted for Romney.)\n</p>\n<p>Our newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward.\nStill, the six small dailies we owned throughout 2012 had unchanged revenues for the year, a result far superior to\nthat experienced by big-city dailies. Moreover, the two large papers we operated throughout the year \xe2\x80\x93 The Buffalo\nNews and the Omaha World-Herald \xe2\x80\x93 held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.\nAmong newspapers in America\xe2\x80\x99s 50 largest metropolitan areas, our Buffalo and Omaha papers rank near the top in\ncirculation penetration of their home territories.\n</p>\n<p>This popularity is no accident: Credit the editors of those papers \xe2\x80\x93 Margaret Sullivan at the News and Mike\nReilly at the World-Herald \xe2\x80\x94 for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable to\ncommunity-interested readers. (Margaret, I regret to say, recently left us to join The New York Times, whose job\noffers are tough to turn down. That paper made a great hire, and we wish her the best.)\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensible\nInternet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meet\nor exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not\ncontinue the operation of any business doomed to unending losses. One daily paper that we acquired in a bulk\npurchase from Media General was significantly unprofitable under that company\xe2\x80\x99s ownership. After analyzing the\npaper\xe2\x80\x99s results, we saw no remedy for the losses and reluctantly shut it down. All of our remaining dailies, however,\nshould be profitable for a long time to come. (They are listed on page 108.) At appropriate prices \xe2\x80\x93 and that\nmeans at a very low multiple of current earnings \xe2\x80\x93 we will purchase more papers of the type we like.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nA milestone in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper operations occurred at yearend when Stan Lipsey retired as publisher\n</p>\n<p>of The Buffalo News. It\xe2\x80\x99s no exaggeration for me to say that the News might now be extinct were it not for Stan.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I acquired the News in April 1977. It was an evening paper, dominant on weekdays but lacking\na Sunday edition. Throughout the country, the circulation trend was toward morning papers. Moreover, Sunday\nwas becoming ever more critical to the profitability of metropolitan dailies. Without a Sunday paper, the News was\ndestined to lose out to its morning competitor, which had a fat and entrenched Sunday product.\n</p>\n<p>We therefore began to print a Sunday edition late in 1977. And then all hell broke loose. Our competitor\nsued us, and District Judge Charles Brieant, Jr. authored a harsh ruling that crippled the introduction of our paper.\nHis ruling was later reversed \xe2\x80\x93 after 17 long months \xe2\x80\x93 in a 3-0 sharp rebuke by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\nWhile the appeal was pending, we lost circulation, hemorrhaged money and stood in constant danger of going out of\nbusiness.\n</p>\n<p>Enter Stan Lipsey, a friend of mine from the 1960s, who, with his wife, had sold Berkshire a small Omaha\nweekly. I found Stan to be an extraordinary newspaperman, knowledgeable about every aspect of circulation,\nproduction, sales and editorial. (He was a key person in gaining that small weekly a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.) So\nwhen I was in big trouble at the News, I asked Stan to leave his comfortable way of life in Omaha to take over in\nBuffalo.\n</p>\n<p>He never hesitated. Along with Murray Light, our editor, Stan persevered through four years of very dark\ndays until the News won the competitive struggle in 1982. Ever since, despite a difficult Buffalo economy, the\nperformance of the News has been exceptional. As both a friend and as a manager, Stan is simply the best.\n</p>\n<p>18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Dividends\n</p>\n<p>A number of Berkshire shareholders \xe2\x80\x93 including some of my good friends \xe2\x80\x93 would like Berkshire to pay a\ncash dividend. It puzzles them that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns,\nbut pay out nothing ourselves. So let\xe2\x80\x99s examine when dividends do and don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for shareholders.\n</p>\n<p>A profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business \xe2\x80\x93 projects to\nbecome more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economic\nmoat separating the company from its competitors.\n</p>\n<p>I ask the managers of our subsidiaries to unendingly focus on moat-widening opportunities, and they find\nmany that make economic sense. But sometimes our managers misfire. The usual cause of failure is that they start\nwith the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process is\nsubconscious; that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes it so dangerous.\n</p>\n<p>Your chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s 1986 annual report, I described how twenty\nyears of management effort and capital improvements in our original textile business were an exercise in futility. I\nwanted the business to succeed and wished my way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought another New\nEngland textile company.) But wishing makes dreams come true only in Disney movies; it\xe2\x80\x99s poison in business.\n</p>\n<p>Despite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether they\ncan be intelligently deployed in our various businesses. Our record $12.1 billion of fixed-asset investments and bolt-\non acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we have\nan advantage: Because we operate in so many areas of the economy, we enjoy a range of choices far wider than that\nopen to most corporations. In deciding what to do, we can water the flowers and skip over the weeds.\n</p>\n<p>Even after we deploy hefty amounts of capital in our current operations, Berkshire will regularly generate a\nlot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses.\nHere our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholders\nwealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition?\n</p>\n<p>I have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is\nsatisfactory, which means that our shareholders are far wealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for\nacquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends.\n</p>\n<p>But, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That\xe2\x80\x99s particularly\ntrue at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is now\nmore difficult than it has been during most of our years.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF is\na case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the funds\nrequired for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though large\ntransactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean.\n</p>\n<p>The third use of funds \xe2\x80\x93 repurchases \xe2\x80\x93 is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful\ndiscount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds\nintelligently: It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to go wrong when you\xe2\x80\x99re buying dollar bills for 80\xc2\xa2 or less. We explained our criteria for\nrepurchases in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. We\noriginally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, we\nincreased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value.\n</p>\n<p>19</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are\nmade above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningful\nway by purchases up to our 120% limit.\n</p>\n<p>And that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The\nnumbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends. So\nbear with me.\n</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. The\nbusiness earns 12% on tangible net worth \xe2\x80\x93 $240,000 \xe2\x80\x93 and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% on\nreinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of net\nworth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million.\n</p>\n<p>You would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our company\xe2\x80\x99s annual earnings and\nhave two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income and\ncapital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase the\nfuture earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one-\nthird payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8%\neach year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).\n</p>\n<p>After ten years our company would have a net worth of $4,317,850 (the original $2 million compounded at\n8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656\n(125% of our half of the company\xe2\x80\x99s net worth). And we would live happily ever after \xe2\x80\x93 with dividends and the\nvalue of our stock continuing to grow at 8% annually.\n</p>\n<p>There is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we\nwould leave all earnings in the company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be sold\nat 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would grow\nannually. Call this option the \xe2\x80\x9csell-off\xe2\x80\x9d approach.\n</p>\n<p>Under this \xe2\x80\x9csell-off\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years\n($2 million compounded at 12%). Because we would be selling shares each year, our percentage ownership would\nhave declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the net\nworth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable to\neach of us can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the market value of your remaining shares would be $2,804,425, about\n4% greater than the value of your shares if we had followed the dividend approach.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you\nwould have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! \xe2\x80\x93 you would have both more cash to spend annually and\nmore capital value.\n</p>\n<p>This calculation, of course, assumes that our hypothetical company can earn an average of 12% annually on\nnet worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, the\nS&amp;P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth.\nBoth assumptions also seem reasonable for Berkshire, though certainly not assured.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the\nargument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s history \xe2\x80\x93 admittedly one that won\xe2\x80\x99t come\nclose to being repeated \xe2\x80\x93 the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramatically superior to\nthe dividend policy.\n</p>\n<p>Aside from the favorable math, there are two further \xe2\x80\x93 and important \xe2\x80\x93 arguments for a sell-off policy.\nFirst, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, those\nwho wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. It\nis safe to say, however, that a great many of them \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps even most of them \xe2\x80\x93 are in a net-savings mode and\nlogically should prefer no payment at all.\n</p>\n<p>20</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receipts\nand capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholders\nelect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use his\ndividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also pay\na 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take place\nat 125% of book value.)\n</p>\n<p>The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all\ntaxpaying shareholders are inferior \xe2\x80\x93 usually far inferior \xe2\x80\x93 to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend\nprogram, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax on\nonly the gain portion of the cash receipts.\n</p>\n<p>Let me end this math exercise \xe2\x80\x93 and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill \xe2\x80\x93 by using my\nown case to illustrate how a shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased\ninvestment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 41\xe2\x81\x844% of my Berkshire\nshares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) has\ndecreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentage of the company has significantly decreased.\n</p>\n<p>Yet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in\nBerkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figures\nare $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have far more money working for me\nat Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It\xe2\x80\x99s also true that my share of\nboth Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic business value and the company\xe2\x80\x99s normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005.\nOver time, I expect this accretion of value to continue \xe2\x80\x93 albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion \xe2\x80\x93 even as I now\nannually give away more than 41\xe2\x81\x842% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I\xe2\x80\x99ve recently doubled my\nlifetime pledges to certain foundations).\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAbove all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will\n</p>\n<p>confuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of his\nCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits, a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition\nof Security Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a\nrestaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t switch\ncapriciously between the two and retain the fans of either.\n</p>\n<p>Most companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very\nreluctantly. Our \xe2\x80\x9cBig Four\xe2\x80\x9d portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certain\ncases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively.\n</p>\n<p>We applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and\nwe love repurchases at appropriate prices.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible\nand that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policy\nas long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable.\nIf the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.\n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>The annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 4th at the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova will be in\ncharge. (Though that\xe2\x80\x99s a new name, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same wonderful Carrie as last year; she got married in June to a very\nlucky guy.) All of our headquarters group pitches in to help her; the whole affair is a homemade production, and I\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more proud of those who put it together.\n</p>\n<p>21</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '21': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our second International Newspaper Tossing\nChallenge. The target will be the porch of a Clayton Home, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. Last year I\nsuccessfully fought off all challengers. But now Berkshire has acquired a large number of newspapers and with\nthem came much tossing talent (or so the throwers claim). Come see whether their talent matches their talk. Better\nyet, join in. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands).\n</p>\n<p>At 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink\xe2\x80\x99s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie\nand I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\xe2\x80\x99s question periods, please do so\nwhile Charlie is talking.\n</p>\n<p>The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall\nthat adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, and\nmost locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,090 pairs of Justin boots, (that\xe2\x80\x99s a pair every\n30 seconds), 10,010 pounds of See\xe2\x80\x99s candy, 12,879 Quikut knives (24 knives per minute) and 5,784 pairs of Wells\nLamont gloves, always a hot item. But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness\nsimply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shopped at our meeting.\n</p>\n<p>Last year, Brooks, our running shoe company, exhibited for the first time and ran up sales of $150,000.\nBrooks is on fire: Its volume in 2012 grew 34%, and that was on top of a similar 34% gain in 2011. The company\xe2\x80\x99s\nmanagement expects another jump of 23% in 2013. We will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at\nthe meeting.\n</p>\n<p>On Sunday at 8 a.m., we will initiate the \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire 5K,\xe2\x80\x9d a race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for\nparticipating will be included in the Visitor\xe2\x80\x99s Guide that you will receive with your credentials for the meeting. We\nwill have plenty of categories for competition, including one for the media. (It will be fun to report on their\nperformance.) Regretfully, I will forego running; someone has to man the starting gun.\n</p>\n<p>I should warn you that we have a lot of home-grown talent. Ted Weschler has run the marathon in 3:01.\nJim Weber, Brooks\xe2\x80\x99 dynamic CEO, is another speedster with a 3:31 best. Todd Combs specializes in the triathlon,\nbut has been clocked at 22 minutes in the 5K.\n</p>\n<p>That, however, is just the beginning: Our directors are also fleet of foot (that is, some of our directors are).\nSteve Burke has run an amazing 2:39 Boston marathon. (It\xe2\x80\x99s a family thing; his wife, Gretchen, finished the New\nYork marathon in 3:25.) Charlotte Guyman\xe2\x80\x99s best is 3:37, and Sue Decker crossed the tape in New York in 3:36.\nCharlie did not return his questionnaire.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the\ncountry. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%).\nThis special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The\ndiscount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of your\nexisting insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.\n</p>\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new ones.\nCarol Loomis, who has been invaluable to me in editing this letter since 1977, has recently authored Tap Dancing to\nWork: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything. She and I have cosigned 500 copies, available exclusively at the\nmeeting.\n</p>\n<p>The Outsiders, by William Thorndike, Jr., is an outstanding book about CEOs who excelled at capital\nallocation. It has an insightful chapter on our director, Tom Murphy, overall the best business manager I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever\nmet. I also recommend The Clash of the Cultures by Jack Bogle and Laura Rittenhouse\xe2\x80\x99s Investing Between the\nLines. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\n</p>\n<p>The Omaha World-Herald will again have a booth, offering a few books it has recently published. Red-\nblooded Husker fans \xe2\x80\x93 is there any Nebraskan who isn\xe2\x80\x99t one? \xe2\x80\x93 will surely want to purchase Unbeatable. It tells the\nstory of Nebraska football during 1993-97, a golden era in which Tom Osborne\xe2\x80\x99s teams went 60-3.\n</p>\n<p>22</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '22': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>If you are a big spender \xe2\x80\x93 or aspire to become one \xe2\x80\x93 visit Signature Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday.

Live a little.\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices\nfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus\nOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 21\xe2\x81\x842 hours, and it may be that you can save significant money,\nparticularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.\n</p>\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d discount pricing. Last year the store did $35.9 million of business during its\nannual meeting sale, an all-time record that makes other retailers turn green. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you\nmust make your purchases between Tuesday, April 30th and Monday, May 6th inclusive, and also present your\nmeeting credential. The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers\nthat normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made\nan exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through\nSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic\nto which you are all invited.\n</p>\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 3rd. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 5th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nOn Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in all of\nDecember, normally a jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s best month.\n</p>\n<p>Around 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Last year my sales totaled $1.5 million.\nThis year I won\xe2\x80\x99t quit until I hit $2 million. Because I need to leave well before sundown, I will be desperate to do\nbusiness. Come take advantage of me. Ask for my \xe2\x80\x9cCrazy Warren\xe2\x80\x9d price.\n</p>\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 29th through Saturday, May 11th. During that period, please\nidentify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you\nare a Berkshire holder.\n</p>\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will\ntake on all comers \xe2\x80\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \xe2\x80\x93 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkable\nmagician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two\nof the world\xe2\x80\x99s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don\xe2\x80\x99t play\nthem for money.\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s and Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 5th. Both\nwill be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants are\nmy favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s, call\n402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and at Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s, order a giant root beer\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one. (I once saw Bill Gates polish off two of the giant variety after a\nfull-course dinner; that\xe2\x80\x99s when I knew he would make a great director.)\n</p>\n<p>We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting,\nasking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail\naddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC,\nat BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\n</p>\n<p>23</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '23': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting\nand important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it\nconcise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions in\nany email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your\nquestion is selected.)\n</p>\n<p>Last year we had a second panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. All were insurance specialists,\nand shareholders subsequently indicated they wanted a little more variety. Therefore, this year we will have one\ninsurance analyst, Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb will join the\nanalyst panel to ask questions that deal with our non-insurance operations.\n</p>\n<p>Finally \xe2\x80\x93 to spice things up \xe2\x80\x93 we would like to add to the panel a credentialed bear on Berkshire, preferably\none who is short the stock. Not yet having a bear identified, we would like to hear from applicants. The only\nrequirement is that you be an investment professional and negative on Berkshire. The three analysts will bring their\nown Berkshire-specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the market\nclose on a Friday and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional\ninvestors or analysts. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that will further educate\nshareholders about their investment.\n</p>\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists\nand analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we like it. All told, we expect at least 54\nquestions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is some extra\ntime, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will take\nplace at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 11 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-\n</p>\n<p>Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindset to be\nas shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no financial\nneed to work; the joy of hitting business \xe2\x80\x9chome runs\xe2\x80\x9d means as much to them as their paycheck.\n</p>\n<p>Equally important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on\none floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!).\n</p>\n<p>This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 21,500-page\nFederal income tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries,\ngets out the annual report, prepares for the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\xe2\x80\x99s activities \xe2\x80\x93 and\nthe list goes on and on.\n</p>\n<p>They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with 48 universities\n(selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&amp;A day with me. They also handle all kinds of\nrequests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do\nfeel like tap dancing to work every day.\n</p>\n<p>This home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as\nwell. Come to Omaha \xe2\x80\x93 the cradle of capitalism \xe2\x80\x93 on May 4th and chime in.\n</p>\n<p>March 1, 2013 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n</p>\n<p>24</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>'}
