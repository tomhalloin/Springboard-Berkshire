In this table, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\n</p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n</p>\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n</p>\n<p>The per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the\nlast 46 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $95,453, a rate of\n20.2% compounded annually.*\n</p>\n<p>The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that\xe2\x80\x99s working\nout even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d\nearning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share\ncount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we\xe2\x80\x99ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this\ntransaction have turned out very well.\n</p>\n<p>A \xe2\x80\x9cnormal year,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire\nand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earning\npower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business\nclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and\nseveral others that I will explain in the \xe2\x80\x9cInvestment\xe2\x80\x9d section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of the\nassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or\nlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base.\n</p>\n<p>Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF\xe2\x80\x99s future because railroads have major cost and environmental\nadvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record\n500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That\xe2\x80\x99s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means\nour railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced\ngreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.\n</p>\n<p>Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better\nsituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our\nchecks will clear.\n</p>\n<p>Last year \xe2\x80\x93 in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy \xe2\x80\x93 we demonstrated our enthusiasm\nfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount,\n$5.4 billion \xe2\x80\x93 or 90% of the total \xe2\x80\x93 was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad in\nthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a new\nrecord for capital spending \xe2\x80\x93 $8 billion \xe2\x80\x93 and spend all of the $2 billion increase in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>Money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.\nCommentators today often talk of \xe2\x80\x9cgreat uncertainty.\xe2\x80\x9d But think back, for example, to December 6,\n1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always\nuncertain.\n</p>\n<p>* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/1500th of those shown for A.\n</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Don\xe2\x80\x99t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly\nmoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than\nwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential\nis far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential \xe2\x80\x93 a system that has worked wonders\nfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War \xe2\x80\x93 remains alive and\neffective.\n</p>\n<p>We are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. But\nlook around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and\n1941, America\xe2\x80\x99s best days lie ahead.\n</p>\n<p>Performance\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish\nperformance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye around wherever it lands.\n</p>\n<p>In Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&amp;P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But,\nif we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves could\nhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund.\n</p>\n<p>The challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible.\n</p>\n<p>To eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value \xe2\x80\x93 book value \xe2\x80\x93\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying\nvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we\xe2\x80\x99ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swings\nwildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing.\n</p>\n<p>The table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&amp;P, a performance quite good in the earlier\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums of\ncapital we currently manage eliminate any chance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for\nbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard.\n</p>\n<p>Yearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of\nthe earth\xe2\x80\x99s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or\noperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year on\nadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amount\nproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many large\ninvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road.\n</p>\n<p>To provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly\nfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tell\nan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980s. The market\xe2\x80\x99s golden period,\nhowever, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative\nadvantage narrowed.\n</p>\n<p>After 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory\nperformance relative to the S&amp;P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute\nresults.\n</p>\n<p>Looking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&amp;P \xe2\x80\x93 though that result is, of\ncourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results in\nbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets.\n</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>',

Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\nvalue.\n</p>\n<p>The first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend these\ntotaled $158 billion at market value.\n</p>\n<p>Insurance float \xe2\x80\x93 money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us \xe2\x80\x93\nfunds $66 billion of our investments. This float is \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaning\nthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile,\nswinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been significantly\nprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of our\ninvestments \xe2\x80\x93 those funded both by float and by retained earnings \xe2\x80\x93 can be viewed as an element of value for\nBerkshire shareholders.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\ninsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106.\nIn Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that will\ncontinue.\n</p>\n<p>The following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investments\napplicable to minority interests.\n</p>\n<p>Yearend\nPer-Share\n</p>\n<p>Investments Period\nCompounded Annual Increase\n</p>\n<p>in Per-Share Investments\n</p>\n<p>1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 66\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 754 1970-1980 27.5%\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,798 1980-1990 26.3%\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50,229 1990-2000 20.5%\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 94,730 2000-2010 6.6%\n</p>\n<p>Though our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the\n40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operating\nbusinesses.\n</p>\n<p>The payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our\nnon-insurance businesses have increased, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests.\n</p>\n<p>Year\nPer-Share\n</p>\n<p>Pre-Tax Earnings Period\nCompounded Annual Increase in\n</p>\n<p>Per-Share Pre-Tax Earnings\n</p>\n<p>1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2.87\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . 19.01 1970-1980 20.8%\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . 102.58 1980-1990 18.4%\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . 918.66 1990-2000 24.5%\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,926.04 2000-2010 20.5%\n</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>For the forty years, our compounded annual gain in pre-tax, non-insurance earnings per share is 21.0%.\nDuring the same period, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s stock price increased at a rate of 22.1% annually. Over time, you can expect\nour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsic\nvalue often follow very different paths \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes for extended periods \xe2\x80\x93 but eventually they meet.\n</p>\n<p>There is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many other\nbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presently\nemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dollars into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills.\n</p>\n<p>This \xe2\x80\x9cwhat-will-they-do-with-the-money\xe2\x80\x9d factor must always be evaluated along with the\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat-do-we-have-now\xe2\x80\x9d calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company\xe2\x80\x99s\nintrinsic value. That\xe2\x80\x99s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s current value; if the CEO\xe2\x80\x99s talents or motives are suspect, today\xe2\x80\x99s value must be discounted. The\ndifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck\xe2\x80\x99s or Montgomery\nWard\xe2\x80\x99s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at a\ndecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from our\ncurrent businesses and more major acquisitions. We\xe2\x80\x99re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my\ntrigger finger is itchy.\n</p>\n<p>Partially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a\ncadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire.\nMany of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They are\nvolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can\xe2\x80\x99t be lured\naway.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at\nheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years\n(it\xe2\x80\x99s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managers\nto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in people\nrather than process. A \xe2\x80\x9chire well, manage little\xe2\x80\x9d code suits both them and me.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MBAs; others never finished college. Some use\nbudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squad\ncomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required.\n</p>\n<p>Our second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the\nneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves to\nreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a\n\xe2\x80\x9cuniverse\xe2\x80\x9d for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.\nCompetition for the few opportunities that are available tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, as\na girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be great\nfor the girl, but terrible for the boys.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle \xe2\x80\x93 and frequently we\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others.\n</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>When I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in\ntextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was to\npursue \xe2\x80\x9copportunities\xe2\x80\x9d to improve and expand the existing textile operation \xe2\x80\x93 so for years that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\ndid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh!\nEventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries.\n</p>\n<p>There is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the\nattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available in\nmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don\xe2\x80\x99t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculously\nhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securities\nand bide our time.\n</p>\n<p>Our flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We have\nbeen able to take money we earn from, say, See\xe2\x80\x99s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, but\nalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF.\n</p>\n<p>Our final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses,\nculture counts.\n</p>\n<p>To start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide them\ndirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess up\nwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families own\nBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s actions and results\nwith keen interest and an owner\xe2\x80\x99s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards.\n</p>\n<p>This same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who have\nsought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to us\nwith an owner\xe2\x80\x99s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managers\nwho love their businesses is no small advantage.\n</p>\n<p>Cultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shape your houses and then they shape\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperial\ncorporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer CEO when you\nget in the back seat of your car and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move.\xe2\x80\x9d) At Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWorld Headquarters\xe2\x80\x9d our annual rent is\n$270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech\nequipment \xe2\x80\x93 you name it \xe2\x80\x93 totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own,\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s managers are likely to be careful with it as well.\n</p>\n<p>Our compensation programs, our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with an\neye to reinforcing the Berkshire culture, and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent.\nThis culture grows stronger every year, and it will remain intact long after Charlie and I have left the scene.\n</p>\n<p>We will need all of the strengths I\xe2\x80\x99ve just described to do reasonably well. Our managers will deliver;\nyou can count on that. But whether Charlie and I can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on the\ncompetitive environment for acquisitions. You will get our best efforts.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO\n</p>\n<p>Now let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far\nexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories.\n</p>\n<p>Sixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a\n20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a\nonce-a-week class at the school.\n</p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>One day at the library, I checked out Ben\xe2\x80\x99s entry in Who\xe2\x80\x99s Who in America and found he was\nchairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had\nnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, after\nreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train for\nWashington.\n</p>\n<p>Alas, when I arrived at the company\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I could\ntalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson.\n</p>\n<p>That was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, \xe2\x80\x9cDavy\xe2\x80\x9d gave me an education about both\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated from\nColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which got\nme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon after\nmeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.)\n</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got\ninto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened \xe2\x80\x93 with the stock falling by\nmore than 95% \xe2\x80\x93 Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the years\nincreased to 50% because of GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s cost for this half of the business\nwas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.)\n</p>\n<p>We then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95,\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside with\nBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, \xe2\x80\x9cNext time, Warren, please make an appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n</p>\n<p>A lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal \xe2\x80\x93 saving Americans substantial\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance \xe2\x80\x93 remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 or\nwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder\xe2\x80\x99s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this\nobjective, the company has grown to be America\xe2\x80\x99s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%.\n</p>\n<p>When Tony Nicely, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistent\ngrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low.\n</p>\n<p>Let me quantify Tony\xe2\x80\x99s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn\xe2\x80\x99t already\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangible\nnet worth of $1.9 billion.\n</p>\n<p>The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value \xe2\x80\x93 $2.7 billion \xe2\x80\x93 was what we estimated\nGEICO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgoodwill\xe2\x80\x9d to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders\nwho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in\npremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were\nannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary\ninsurer: Because of the company\xe2\x80\x99s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal.\n</p>\n<p>Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO\nincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value\ndecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97%-of-premium-volume yardstick we\napplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And this\nvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO \xe2\x80\x93 off to a strong start in 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 is the\ngift that keeps giving.\n</p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>One not-so-small footnote: Under Tony, GEICO has developed one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest personal-\nlines insurance agencies, which primarily sells homeowners policies to our GEICO auto insurance customers. In\nthis business, we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. They take the risk; we simply sign\nup the customers. Last year we sold 769,898 new policies at this agency operation, up 34% from the year before.\nThe obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue; equally important is the fact that it\nfurther strengthens our relationship with our policyholders, helping us retain them.\n</p>\n<p>I owe an enormous debt to Tony and Davy (and, come to think of it, to that janitor as well).\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll present them\nas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them.\n</p>\n<p>We will look first at insurance, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s core operation and the engine that has propelled our\nexpansion over the years.\n</p>\n<p>Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Property-casualty (\xe2\x80\x9cP/C\xe2\x80\x9d) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases,\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums \xe2\x80\x93 money we call \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that will eventually go to\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. Though individual policies and claims\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume.\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the\nfollowing table:\n</p>\n<p>Yearend\nFloat\n</p>\n<p>(in $ millions)\n</p>\n<p>1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 39\n1980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 237\n1990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,632\n2000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,871\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65,832\n</p>\n<p>If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free\nmoney \xe2\x80\x93 and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a\nsignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State\nFarm, by far the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in\nseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite\nprofitably in most \xe2\x80\x93 though certainly not all \xe2\x80\x93 future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than\ncost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holding\nits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit.\n</p>\n<p>10</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a\nwhole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the\nindustry\xe2\x80\x99s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding economics exist only\nbecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already told you about GEICO,\nbut we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>First off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one\nelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most\nimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks\nthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative than most large insurers\nin that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annual\npremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades.\n</p>\n<p>From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion and\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By his\naccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonite\nbounces off Ajit.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>We have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\n</p>\n<p>At bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of all exposures\nthat might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average,\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if the\nappropriate premium can\xe2\x80\x99t be obtained.\n</p>\n<p>Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes has\nled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other guy is doing it so we must as well\xe2\x80\x9d spells\ntrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance.\n</p>\n<p>Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\xe2\x80\x99s huge\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Finally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, the\nfloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\n</p>\n<p>Here is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses:\n</p>\n<p>Underwriting Profit Yearend Float\n</p>\n<p>(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2010 2009 2010 2009\n</p>\n<p>General Re . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 452 $ 477 $20,049 $21,014\nBH Reinsurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 176 250 30,370 27,753\nGEICO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,117 649 10,272 9,613\nOther Primary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 268 84 5,141 5,061\n</p>\n<p>$2,013 $1,460 $65,832 $63,441\n</p>\n<p>Among large insurance operations, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s impresses me as the best in the world.\n</p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Manufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\n</p>\n<p>Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

Some of the businesses\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about\nbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics of\nthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes\nmy eyesight has been poor.\n</p>\n<p>Most of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look\nfirst at the record-breakers.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008)\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, with\nNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes are\npedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI\xe2\x80\x99s exceptional performance is created\nby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates.\n</p>\n<p>12</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings\nas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter).\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need; Pete Liegl, the company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products at\nthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Report\nabout Vic Mancinelli, the company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 million\nfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt.\nLast year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. When\nwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a new\nrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim has\nbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by Frank\nRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golf\ncourse.\n</p>\n<p>A huge story in this sector\xe2\x80\x99s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can\xe2\x80\x99t overstate the\nbreadth and importance of Dave Sokol\xe2\x80\x99s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional\nownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five times\nthat of its nearest competitor. Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanics\nand service personnel. This crew again did its job in 2010, with customer satisfaction, as delineated in our regular\nsurveys, hitting new highs.\n</p>\n<p>Even though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its\nacquisition in 1998, were a failure. In the 11 years through 2009, the company reported an aggregate pre-tax loss\nof $157 million, a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at NetJets were heavily subsidized by its\nfree use of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s credit. Had NetJets been operating on a stand-alone basis, its loss over the years would\nhave been several hundreds of millions greater.\n</p>\n<p>We are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee. Despite this fee (which\ncame to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918 million from 2009.\nDave\xe2\x80\x99s quick restructuring of management and the company\xe2\x80\x99s rationalization of its purchasing and spending\npolicies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s only major business problem into a\nsolidly profitable operation.\n</p>\n<p>Dave has meanwhile maintained NetJets\xe2\x80\x99 industry-leading reputation for safety and service. In many\nimportant ways, our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the FAA.\nMaintaining top-of-the-line standards is the right thing to do, but I also have a selfish reason for championing this\npolicy. My family and I have flown more than 5,000 hours on NetJets (that\xe2\x80\x99s equal to being airborne 24 hours a\nday for seven months) and will fly thousands of hours more in the future. We receive no special treatment and\nhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know we\nare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation.\n</p>\n<p>The largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130\nbusinesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchase\nof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase the\nremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmon\nwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership.\n</p>\n<p>13</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Next to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years.\nIn 2010, Grady Rosier\xe2\x80\x99s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billion\noperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, an\noperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic CEO. David is\nleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wine\nand Spirits in Tennessee.\n</p>\n<p>At Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Sales\nare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny\nGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar\xe2\x80\x99s main competitors.\n</p>\n<p>All that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle.\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits are\nfar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010\ncompared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400.\n</p>\n<p>A housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at some\npoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the past\neleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for\n$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed next\nyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. These\nbusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever.\n</p>\n<p>Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses\n</p>\n<p>We have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this\nletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\n</p>\n<p>A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated\nassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is\nnot needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply covers\ntheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF\xe2\x80\x99s car loadings far off peak levels, the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s interest coverage was 6:1.\n</p>\n<p>Both companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major\ninvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn the\nrespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earn\nreasonable earnings on future capital investments.\n</p>\n<p>Earlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country\xe2\x80\x99s future. Rail moves 42% of\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad \xe2\x80\x93 about 28%\nof the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of all inter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S.\nis transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher.\n</p>\n<p>All of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American\neconomy\xe2\x80\x99s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along with\nits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society\xe2\x80\x99s needs, not\nmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation,\nwith this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our huge\nincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin.\n</p>\n<p>At MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \xe2\x80\x9csocial compact.\xe2\x80\x9d We are expected to put up ever-\nincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, we\nknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments.\n</p>\n<p>14</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>MidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport\n8% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day.\n</p>\n<p>MidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s interest is 89.8%) and its\ncustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\xe2\x80\x99s\nperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent\nreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River.\n</p>\n<p>In its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since we\npurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state has\nraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the two\nutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told that\ncomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area.\n</p>\n<p>MidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, more\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested or\ncommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican\nretains all of its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn.\n</p>\n<p>As you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at\nBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they have\naccomplished for Berkshire shareholders.

CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressed\nand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of\n$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010.\n</p>\n<p>At Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peak\nyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would have\nbeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 report\ncontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed through\nthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate the\nprice advantage that manufactured homes offer.\n</p>\n<p>We finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore,\nshould be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country\xe2\x80\x99s home-loan practices. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look.\n</p>\n<p>Clayton owns 200,804 mortgages that it originated. (It also has some mortgage portfolios that it\npurchased.) At the origination of these contracts, the average FICO score of our borrowers was 648, and 47%\nwere 640 or below. Your banker will tell you that people with such scores are generally regarded as questionable\ncredits.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, our portfolio has performed well during conditions of stress. Here\xe2\x80\x99s our loss experience\nduring the last five years for originated loans:\n</p>\n<p>Year\nNet Losses as a Percentage\n</p>\n<p>of Average Loans\n</p>\n<p>2006 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.53%\n2007 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.27%\n2008 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.17%\n2009 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.86%\n2010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.72%\n</p>\n<p>Our borrowers get in trouble when they lose their jobs, have health problems, get divorced, etc. The\nrecession has hit them hard. But they want to stay in their homes, and generally they borrowed sensible amounts\nin relation to their income. In addition, we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account, which\nmeans we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. If we were stupid in our lending, we were going to\npay the price. That concentrates the mind.\n</p>\n<p>If home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers, America would not have had the\ncrisis that it did. Our approach was simply to get a meaningful down-payment and gear fixed monthly payments\nto a sensible percentage of income. This policy kept Clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes.\n</p>\n<p>Home ownership makes sense for most Americans, particularly at today\xe2\x80\x99s lower prices and bargain\ninterest rates. All things considered, the third best investment I ever made was the purchase of my home, though I\nwould have made far more money had I instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks. (The two best\ninvestments were wedding rings.) For the $31,500 I paid for our house, my family and I gained 52 years of\nterrific memories with more to come.\n</p>\n<p>16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>But a house can be a nightmare if the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are bigger than his wallet and if a lender \xe2\x80\x93 often\nprotected by a government guarantee \xe2\x80\x93 facilitates his fantasy.

Our share of the\nundistributed earnings of these investees, however, was more than $2 billion last year. These retained earnings\nare important. In our experience \xe2\x80\x93 and, for that matter, in the experience of investors over the past century \xe2\x80\x93\nundistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains, albeit in a highly irregular manner.\n(Indeed, sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. As one investor said in 2009: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is worse than divorce.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost half my net worth \xe2\x80\x93 and I still have my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d) In the future, we expect our market gains to eventually at\nleast equal the earnings our investees retain.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>In our earlier estimate of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to\nfuture investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just\ndescribed).\n</p>\n<p>The first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these \xe2\x80\x93 our Swiss Re\nnote \xe2\x80\x93 was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others \xe2\x80\x93 our Goldman Sachs and General Electric\npreferred stocks \xe2\x80\x93 are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October\nand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but has\nbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light\nbefore long.\n</p>\n<p>17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>All three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so \xe2\x80\x93 in aggregate about $1.4 billion \xe2\x80\x93\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly\nreduced. That\xe2\x80\x99s the bad news.\n</p>\n<p>There are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least\n$500 million \xe2\x80\x93 and perhaps much more \xe2\x80\x93 to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of\n\xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can\xe2\x80\x99t come too soon for me: To update\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don\xe2\x80\x99t fault the Fed: For\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.)\n</p>\n<p>At some point, probably soon, the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\n</p>\n<p>Other companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to see our share of\nCoke\xe2\x80\x99s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful\nbusiness.\n</p>\n<p>Overall, I believe our \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Last summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 \xe2\x80\x93 an age Charlie and\nI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire \xe2\x80\x93 his call was a surprise.\n</p>\n<p>Lou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been\ninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates only\nbecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that?\n</p>\n<p>Lou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment\ngreats. We will miss him.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Four years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren\xe2\x80\x99t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediately\navailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved is\ncrucial, as is the manager\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xe2\x80\x93 and sensitivity to \xe2\x80\x93 risk (which in no way should be measured by\nbeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with a\nhard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally,\nwe wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job.\n</p>\n<p>18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>When Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&amp;P. We have\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by\nundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have\nreceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their\nlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started\nanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past\nlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners.\n</p>\n<p>As long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s holdings, both bonds\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can reset\nannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to\nrequire style boxes such as \xe2\x80\x9clong-short,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmacro,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cinternational equities.\xe2\x80\x9d At Berkshire our only style box is\n\xe2\x80\x9csmart.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n</p>\n<p>Over time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager\xe2\x80\x99s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own\nportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for\nindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition.\n</p>\n<p>When Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful\nperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted \xe2\x80\x93 but not to have a vote \xe2\x80\x93 on the\nwisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition.\n</p>\n<p>One footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd\xe2\x80\x99s joining us, a number of commentators\npointed out that he was \xe2\x80\x9clittle-known\xe2\x80\x9d and expressed puzzlement that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek a \xe2\x80\x9cbig-name.\xe2\x80\x9d I wonder\nhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goal\nwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops \xe2\x80\x93 that may not be the smartest\nmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.)\n</p>\n<p>Derivatives\n</p>\n<p>Two years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives\ncontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over at\nGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and the\nunwinding or expiration of some contracts.\n</p>\n<p>Our continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories.\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assuming\nrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are\nidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front when\nwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That\xe2\x80\x99s important.\n</p>\n<p>Our first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor\nexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies.\n</p>\n<p>In aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an \xe2\x80\x9cunderwriting\nprofit,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we would\nbenefit from the use of float.\n</p>\n<p>19</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Subsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today,\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, it\nappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have had\nthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged the\nright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago.\n</p>\n<p>Our other large derivatives position \xe2\x80\x93 whose contracts go by the name of \xe2\x80\x9cequity puts\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 involves\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the\nU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S.\nand the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of these\ncontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination date\ncounts: No payments can be required before then.\n</p>\n<p>As a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally\nreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million.\nConsequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that\n$647 million for about three years.\n</p>\n<p>Those 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion.\n</p>\n<p>The future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 \xe2\x80\x93\nand foreign exchange rates are unchanged \xe2\x80\x93 we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to\n2026. You can call this amount \xe2\x80\x9csettlement value.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>On our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will record\na $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion and\nthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability will\nfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that,\nof course, is far from a sure thing.\n</p>\n<p>What is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d of $4.2 billion for an average of about\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance float\nfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase\nof BNSF.\n</p>\n<p>As I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post\ncollateral \xe2\x80\x93 a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling\ncomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases.\nForegoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it.\n</p>\n<p>On Reporting and Misreporting: The Numbers That Count and Those That Don\xe2\x80\x99t\n</p>\n<p>Earlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire and\nmeasuring its progress.\n</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net\nincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire.\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could \xe2\x80\x93 quite legally \xe2\x80\x93 cause net income in any\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like.\n</p>\n<p>20</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We have that flexibility because realized gains or losses on investments go into the net income figure,\nwhereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a\n$10 billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses. Our net\nincome \xe2\x80\x93 which would count only the loss \xe2\x80\x93 would be reported as less than our operating income. If we had\nmeanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% when\nin reality our business might be much improved.\n</p>\n<p>If we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because\nwe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I have\nnever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We both\nhave a deep disgust for \xe2\x80\x9cgame playing\xe2\x80\x9d with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate America\nin the 1990s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to.\n</p>\n<p>Operating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how our\nbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But if\nyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours.\n</p>\n<p>Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value.\nPay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on the\nright track.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>As a p.s., I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity puts\nhad a termination date of June 30, 2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties at\nthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figure\ndown to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts\nrequired us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change\nthat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million.\n</p>\n<p>Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our\nmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that\nthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.\n</p>\n<p>We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is\nthe accepted standard for option valuation \xe2\x80\x93 almost all leading business schools teach it \xe2\x80\x93 and we would be\naccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an\ninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-\nScholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of\nboth their values and ours were the two far apart.\n</p>\n<p>Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number.\nCharlie and I can\xe2\x80\x99t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that\ncalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t come up with an exact figure \xe2\x80\x93 anymore than we can come up with a\nprecise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.\n</p>\n<p>John Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly.\nWitness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and\n1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it \xe2\x80\x9canomalies.\xe2\x80\x9d (I always love explanations of that kind:\nThe Flat Earth Society probably views a ship\xe2\x80\x99s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential,\nanomaly.)\n</p>\n<p>21</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '21': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Academics\xe2\x80\x99 current practice of teaching Black-Scholes as revealed truth needs re-examination. For that\nmatter, so does the academic\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as\nan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to\nvalue a business. That\xe2\x80\x99s what investing is all about.\n</p>\n<p>Life and Debt\n</p>\n<p>The fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is\nequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you\xe2\x80\x99re\nclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, very\nfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade \xe2\x80\x93 and some relearned in\n2008 \xe2\x80\x93 any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by a\nsingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smart\npeople.\n</p>\n<p>Leverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either\nbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by\npayment. For that, only cash will do the job.\n</p>\n<p>Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.\nWhen either is missing, that\xe2\x80\x99s all that is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees.\nIn September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously close\nto bringing our entire country to its knees.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I have no interest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s well-\nbeing. (With our having a combined age of 167, starting over is not on our bucket list.) We are forever conscious\nof the fact that you, our partners, have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. In\naddition, important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. Finally, many disabled victims of accidents\ncaused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now. It would be irresponsible\nfor us to risk what all these constituencies need just to pursue a few points of extra return.\n</p>\n<p>A little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmeet Charlie until he was 35, though he grew up within 100 yards of where I have lived for 52 years and also\nattended the same inner-city public high school in Omaha from which my father, wife, children and two\ngrandchildren graduated. Charlie and I did, however, both work as young boys at my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s grocery store,\nthough our periods of employment were separated by about five years. My grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s name was Ernest, and\nperhaps no man was more aptly named. No one worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped by\nthe experience.\n</p>\n<p>On the facing page you can read a letter sent in 1939 by Ernest to his youngest son, my Uncle Fred.\nSimilar letters went to his other four children. I still have the letter sent to my Aunt Alice, which I found \xe2\x80\x93 along\nwith $1,000 of cash \xe2\x80\x93 when, as executor of her estate, I opened her safe deposit box in 1970.\n</p>\n<p>Ernest never went to business school \xe2\x80\x93 he never in fact finished high school \xe2\x80\x93 but he understood the\nimportance of liquidity as a condition for assured survival. At Berkshire, we have taken his $1,000 solution a bit\nfurther and have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash, excluding that held at our regulated utility\nand railroad businesses. Because of that commitment, we customarily keep at least $20 billion on hand so that we\ncan both withstand unprecedented insurance losses (our largest to date having been about $3 billion from Katrina,\nthe insurance industry\xe2\x80\x99s most expensive catastrophe) and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities,\neven during times of financial turmoil.\n</p>\n<p>22</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '22': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>23</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '23': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We keep our cash largely in U.S. Treasury bills and avoid other short-term securities yielding a few\nmore basis points, a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market funds\nbecame apparent in September 2008. We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe\xe2\x80\x99s observation, \xe2\x80\x9cMore money\nhas been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d At Berkshire, we don\xe2\x80\x99t rely on bank lines, and we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation to\nour liquid assets.\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past\n40 years. Instead, we have retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running\nabout $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those four\ndecades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to building\nup its financial strength in this unrelenting way.\n</p>\n<p>By being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of\nliquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our\neconomy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.\n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>The annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30th. Carrie Kizer from our home office will be the\nringmaster, and her theme this year is Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This gives NetJets, BNSF and BYD a\nchance to show off.\n</p>\n<p>As always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at\n8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\xe2\x80\x99s\nstands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide\nto leave during the day\xe2\x80\x99s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)\n</p>\n<p>The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did\nyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots,\n12,416 pounds of See\xe2\x80\x99s candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards\xc2\xae and 8,800 Quikut knives (that\xe2\x80\x99s 16 knives per\nminute). But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness simply hasn\xe2\x80\x99t learned\nwhere to shop.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For\nat least half of you, I believe we can.\n</p>\n<p>Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 60 books and DVDs, including the Chinese\nlanguage edition of Poor Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can\xe2\x80\x99t read\nChinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite. Should you need to ship\nyour book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a big spender \xe2\x80\x93 or merely a gawker \xe2\x80\x93 visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get your\npulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet.\n</p>\n<p>24</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '24': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who\nhandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,\nbut work with Carol and you will get one.\n</p>\n<p>Airlines have often jacked up prices \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes dramatically so \xe2\x80\x93 for the Berkshire weekend. If you\nare coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus Omaha. The drive is about 21\xe2\x81\x842 hours\nand it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha.\n</p>\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d discount pricing. Last year the store did $33.3 million of business\nduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that \xe2\x80\x93 as far as I know \xe2\x80\x93 exceeds the one-week total of any retail store\nanyplace. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26th and\nMonday, May 2nd inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against\ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.\nWe appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.\nto 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are\nall invited.\n</p>\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st , from\n9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 1 p.m., I will be at Borsheims\nwith a smile and a shoeshine, selling jewelry just as I sold men\xe2\x80\x99s shirts at J.C. Penney\xe2\x80\x99s 63 years ago.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve told Susan Jacques, Borsheims\xe2\x80\x99 CEO, that I\xe2\x80\x99m still a hotshot salesman. But I see doubt in her eyes.\nSo cut loose and buy something from me for your wife or sweetheart (presumably the same person). Make me\nlook good.\n</p>\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25th through Saturday, May 7th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that\nshows you are a Berkshire shareholder.\n</p>\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers \xe2\x80\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \xe2\x80\x93 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon\nOsberg, two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday\nafternoon.\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s and Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1st.\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s opening at 4 p.m. These\nrestaurants are my favorites and \xe2\x80\x93 still being a growing boy \xe2\x80\x93 I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening.\nRemember: To make a reservation at Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and at Piccolo\xe2\x80\x99s\ncall 402-342-9038.\n</p>\n<p>We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking\nCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail\naddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of\nCNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at\narsorkin@nytimes.com.\n</p>\n<p>From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the\nmost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected\nif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than\ntwo questions in any email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name\nmentioned if your question is selected.)\n</p>\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists will pick some tough ones, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we like it.\n</p>\n<p>25</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '25': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We will again have a drawing at 8:15 a.m. on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those\nshareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the\njournalists with those from the winning shareholders. We hope to answer at least 60 questions. From our\nstandpoint, the more the better. Our goal, which we pursue both through these annual letters and by our meeting\ndiscussions, is to give you a better understanding of the business that you own.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. Equally important,\nhowever, are the 20 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on one floor, which is the\nway we intend to keep it!).\n</p>\n<p>This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 14,097-\npage Federal income tax return along with state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media\ninquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\xe2\x80\x99s\nactivities \xe2\x80\x93 and the list goes on and on.\n</p>\n<p>They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life\neasy and joyful. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities\n(selected from 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also\nhandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has\nit better.\n</p>\n<p>This home office crew has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. Come to our Woodstock for\nCapitalism on April 30th and tell them so.\n</p>\n<p>February 26, 2011 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n</p>\n<p>26</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '26': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Memo\nTo: Berkshire Hathaway Managers (\xe2\x80\x9cThe All-Stars\xe2\x80\x9d)\n</p>\n<p>cc: Berkshire Directors\n</p>\n<p>From: Warren E. Buffett\n</p>\n<p>Date: July 26, 2010\n</p>\n<p>This is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s top priority and to get your help on\nsuccession planning (yours, not mine!).\n</p>\n<p>The priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. We can\xe2\x80\x99t be\nperfect but we can try to be. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can afford to lose\nmoney \xe2\x80\x93 even a lot of money. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose reputation \xe2\x80\x93 even a shred of reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d We\nmust continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have\nwritten about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent\nreporter.\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes your associates will say \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody else is doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d This rationale is almost always\na bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a\nmoral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter\nor a judge and see how far it gets them.\n</p>\n<p>If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.\nHowever, it\xe2\x80\x99s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it\xe2\x80\x99s too close to the line\nand should be abandoned. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it\xe2\x80\x99s\nquestionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.\n</p>\n<p>As a corollary, let me know promptly if there\xe2\x80\x99s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad\nnews is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that\nalmost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.\n</p>\n<p>104</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '27': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we\nknew of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number\ngetting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in\nminimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of\nimpropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most\nimportant factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines\nhow an organization behaves.\n</p>\n<p>In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you\ndoes a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don\xe2\x80\x99t need me to\nhelp.

Most of you have\nparticipated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nimportant to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have\nyour thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory.
