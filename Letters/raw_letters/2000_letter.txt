In this table, Berkshire\'s results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules.  In all other respects, the results are calculated\nusing the numbers originally reported.\n</p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P\n500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P in years when the index\nshowed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>3\n</p>\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n</p>\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n</p>\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 2000 was $3.96 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both\nour Class A and Class B stock by 6.5%.  Over the last 36 years (that is, since present management took over) per-\nshare book value has grown from $19 to $40,442, a gain of 23.6% compounded annually.\xe2\x88\x97\n</p>\n<p>Overall, we had a decent year, our book-value gain having outpaced the performance of the S&amp;P 500.\nAnd, though this judgment is necessarily subjective, we believe Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s gain in per-share intrinsic value\nmoderately exceeded its gain in book value.  (Intrinsic value, as well as other key investment and accounting terms\nand concepts, are explained in our Owner\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on pages 59-66.  Intrinsic value is discussed on page 64.)\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we completed two significant acquisitions that we negotiated in 1999 and initiated six more.\nAll told, these purchases have cost us about $8 billion, with 97% of that amount paid in cash and 3% in stock.  The\neight businesses we\xe2\x80\x99ve acquired have aggregate sales of about $13 billion and employ 58,000 people.  Still, we\nincurred no debt in making these purchases, and our shares outstanding have increased only 1/3 of 1%.  Better yet,\nwe remain awash in liquid assets and are both eager and ready for even larger acquisitions.\n</p>\n<p>I will detail our purchases in the next section of the report.  But I will tell you now that we have embraced\nthe 21st century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint.  Try to control your\nexcitement.\n</p>\n<p>On the minus side, policyholder growth at GEICO slowed to a halt as the year progressed.  It has become\nmuch more expensive to obtain new business.  I told you last year that we would get our money\xe2\x80\x99s worth from\nstepped-up advertising at GEICO in 2000, but I was wrong.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll examine the reasons later in the report.\n</p>\n<p>Another negative \xe2\x80\x94 which has persisted for several years \xe2\x80\x94 is that we see our equity portfolio as only\nmildly attractive.  We own stocks of some excellent businesses, but most of our holdings are fully priced and are\nunlikely to deliver more than moderate returns in the future.  We\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in facing this problem:  The long-\nterm prospect for equities in general is far from exciting.\n</p>\n<p>Finally, there is the negative that recurs annually:  Charlie Munger, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Chairman and my\npartner, and I are a year older than when we last reported to you.  Mitigating this adverse development is the\nindisputable fact that the age of your top managers is increasing at a considerably lower rate \xe2\x80\x94 percentage-wise \xe2\x80\x94\nthan is the case at almost all other major corporations.  Better yet, this differential will widen in the future.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I continue to aim at increasing Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s per-share value at a rate that, over time, will\nmodestly exceed the gain from owning the S&amp;P 500.  As the table on the facing page shows, a small annual\nadvantage in our favor can, if sustained, produce an anything-but-small long-term advantage.  To reach our goal\nwe will need to add a few good businesses to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s stable each year, have the businesses we own generally\ngain in value, and avoid any material increase in our outstanding shares.  We are confident about meeting the last\ntwo objectives; the first will require some luck.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate here to thank two groups that made my job both easy and fun last year \xef\xa3\xa7 just as they do\nevery year.  First, our operating managers continue to run their businesses in splendid fashion, which allows me to\nspend my time allocating capital rather than supervising them.  (I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good at that anyway.)\n</p>\n<p>                                                       \n\xe2\x88\x97All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\'s A shares, the successor to the only stock that the\n</p>\n<p>company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>4\n</p>\n<p>Our managers are a very special breed.  At most large companies, the truly talented divisional managers\nseldom have the job they really want.  Instead they yearn to become CEOs, either at their present employer or\nelsewhere.  Indeed, if they stay put, they and their colleagues are likely to feel they have failed.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, our all-stars have exactly the jobs they want, ones that they hope and expect to keep\nthroughout their business lifetimes.  They therefore concentrate solely on maximizing the long-term value of the\nbusinesses that they \xe2\x80\x9cown\xe2\x80\x9d and love.  If the businesses succeed, they have succeeded.  And they stick with us:  In\nour last 36 years, Berkshire has never had a manager of a significant subsidiary voluntarily leave to join another\nbusiness.\n</p>\n<p>The other group to which I owe enormous thanks is the home-office staff.  After the eight acquisitions\nmore than doubled our worldwide workforce to about 112,000, Charlie and I went soft last year and added one\nmore person at headquarters.  (Charlie, bless him, never lets me forget Ben Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s advice: \xe2\x80\x9cA small leak can\nsink a great ship.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Now we have 13.8 people.\n</p>\n<p>This tiny band works miracles.  In 2000 it handled all of the details connected with our eight acquisitions,\nprocessed extensive regulatory and tax filings (our tax return covers 4,896 pages), smoothly produced an annual\nmeeting to which 25,000 tickets were issued, and accurately dispensed checks to 3,660 charities designated by our\nshareholders.  In addition, the group dealt with all the routine tasks served up by a company with a revenue run-\nrate of $40 billion and more than 300,000 owners.   And, to add to all of this, the other 12.8 are a delight to be\naround.\n</p>\n<p>I should pay to have my job.\n</p>\n<p>Acquisitions of 2000\n</p>\n<p>Our acquisition technique at Berkshire is simplicity itself: We answer the phone.  I\xe2\x80\x99m also glad to report\nthat it rings a bit more often now, because owners and/or managers increasingly wish to join their companies with\nBerkshire.  Our acquisition criteria are set forth on page 23, and the number to call is 402-346-1400.\n</p>\n<p>Let me tell you a bit about the businesses we have purchased during the past 14 months, starting with the\ntwo transactions that were initiated in 1999, but closed in 2000.  (This list excludes some smaller purchases that\nwere made by the managers of our subsidiaries and that, in most cases, will be integrated into their operations.)\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 I described the first purchase \xe2\x80\x94 76% of MidAmerican Energy \xe2\x80\x94 in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report.  Because\nof regulatory constraints on our voting privileges, we perform only a \xe2\x80\x9cone-line\xe2\x80\x9d consolidation of\nMidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s earnings and equity in our financial statements.  If we instead fully consolidated\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s figures, our revenues in 2000 would have been $5 billion greater than we\nreported, though net income would remain the same.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 On November 23, 1999, I received a one-page fax from Bruce Cort that appended a Washington\nPost article describing an aborted buyout of CORT Business Services.  Despite his name, Bruce\nhas no connection with CORT.  Rather, he is an airplane broker who had sold Berkshire a jet in\n1986 and who, before the fax, had not been in touch with me for about ten years.\n</p>\n<p>I knew nothing about CORT, but I immediately printed out its SEC filings and liked what I saw.\nThat same day I told Bruce I had a possible interest and asked him to arrange a meeting with\nPaul Arnold, CORT\xe2\x80\x99s CEO.  Paul and I got together on November 29, and I knew at once that we\nhad the right ingredients for a purchase: a fine though unglamorous business, an outstanding\nmanager, and a price (going by that on the failed deal) that made sense.\n</p>\n<p>Operating out of 117 showrooms, CORT is the national leader in \xe2\x80\x9crent-to-rent\xe2\x80\x9d furniture,\nprimarily used in offices but also by temporary occupants of apartments.  This business, it should\nbe noted, has no similarity to \xe2\x80\x9crent-to-own\xe2\x80\x9d operations, which usually involve the sale of home\nfurnishings and electronics to people having limited income and poor credit.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>5\n</p>\n<p>We quickly purchased CORT for Wesco, our 80%-owned subsidiary, paying about $386 million\nin cash.  You will find more details about CORT\xe2\x80\x99s operations in Wesco\xe2\x80\x99s 1999 and 2000 annual\nreports.  Both Charlie and I enjoy working with Paul, and CORT looks like a good bet to beat our\noriginal expectations.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Early last year, Ron Ferguson of General Re put me in contact with Bob Berry, whose family had\nowned U.S. Liability for 49 years.  This insurer, along with two sister companies, is a medium-\nsized, highly-respected writer of unusual risks \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cexcess and surplus lines\xe2\x80\x9d in insurance jargon.\nAfter Bob and I got in touch, we agreed by phone on a half-stock, half-cash deal.\n</p>\n<p>In recent years, Tom Nerney has managed the operation for the Berry family and has achieved a\nrare combination of excellent growth and unusual profitability.  Tom is a powerhouse in other\nways as well.  In addition to having four adopted children (two from Russia), he has an extended\nfamily: the Philadelphia Belles, a young-teen girls basketball team that Tom coaches.  The team\nhad a 62-4 record last year and finished second in the AAU national tournament.\n</p>\n<p>Few property-casualty companies are outstanding businesses.  We have far more than our share,\nand U.S. Liability adds luster to the collection.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Ben Bridge Jeweler was another purchase we made by phone, prior to any face-to-face meeting\nbetween me and the management.  Ed Bridge, who with his cousin, Jon, manages this 65-store\nWest Coast retailer, is a friend of Barnett Helzberg, from whom we bought Helzberg Diamonds\nin 1995.  Upon learning that the Bridge family proposed to sell its company, Barnett gave\nBerkshire a strong recommendation.  Ed then called and explained his business to me, also\nsending some figures, and we made a deal, again half for cash and half for stock.\n</p>\n<p>Ed and Jon are fourth generation owner-managers of a business started 89 years ago in Seattle.\nBoth the business and the family\xe2\x80\x94 including Herb and Bob, the fathers of Jon and Ed \xe2\x80\x94 enjoy\nextraordinary reputations.  Same-store sales have increased by 9%, 11%, 13%, 10%, 12%, 21%\nand 7% over the past seven years, a truly remarkable record.\n</p>\n<p>It was vital to the family that the company operate in the future as in the past.  No one wanted\nanother jewelry chain to come in and decimate the organization with ideas about synergy and\ncost saving (which, though they would never work, were certain to be tried).  I told Ed and Jon\nthat they would be in charge, and they knew I could be believed:  After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that your\nChairman would be a disaster at actually running a store or selling jewelry (though there are\nmembers of his family who have earned black belts as purchasers).\n</p>\n<p>In their typically classy way, the Bridges allocated a substantial portion of the proceeds from their\nsale to the hundreds of co-workers who had helped the company achieve its success.  We\xe2\x80\x99re\nproud to be associated with both the family and the company.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 In July we acquired Justin Industries, the leading maker of Western boots \xe2\x80\x94 including the\nJustin, Tony Lama, Nocona, and Chippewa brands \xef\xa3\xa7 and the premier producer of brick in Texas\nand five neighboring states.\n</p>\n<p>Here again, our acquisition involved serendipity.  On May 4th, I received a fax from Mark Jones,\na stranger to me, proposing that Berkshire join a group to acquire an unnamed company.  I faxed\nhim back, explaining that with rare exceptions we don\xe2\x80\x99t invest with others, but would happily\npay him a commission if he sent details and we later made a purchase.  He replied that the\n\xe2\x80\x9cmystery company\xe2\x80\x9d was Justin.  I then went to Fort Worth to meet John Roach, chairman of the\ncompany and John Justin, who had built the business and was its major shareholder.  Soon after,\nwe bought Justin for $570 million in cash.\n</p>\n<p>John Justin loved Justin Industries but had been forced to retire because of severe health problems\n(which sadly led to his death in late February).  John was a class act \xef\xa3\xa7 as a citizen, businessman\nand human being.  Fortunately, he had groomed two outstanding managers, Harrold Melton at\nAcme and Randy Watson at Justin Boot, each of whom runs his company autonomously.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>6\n</p>\n<p>Acme, the larger of the two operations, produces more than one billion bricks per year at its 22\nplants, about 11.7% of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s national output.  The brick business, however, is necessarily\nregional, and in its territory Acme enjoys unquestioned leadership. When Texans are asked to\nname a brand of brick, 75% respond Acme, compared to 16% for the runner-up.  (Before our\npurchase, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have named a brand of brick.  Could you have?)  This brand recognition is\nnot only due to Acme\xe2\x80\x99s product quality, but also reflects many decades of extraordinary\ncommunity service by both the company and John Justin.\n</p>\n<p>I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist pointing out that Berkshire \xe2\x80\x94 whose top management has long been mired in the\n19th century \xe2\x80\x94 is now one of the very few authentic \xe2\x80\x9cclicks-and-bricks\xe2\x80\x9d businesses around.  We\nwent into 2000 with GEICO doing significant business on the Internet, and then we added Acme.\nYou can bet this move by Berkshire is making them sweat in Silicon Valley.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 In June, Bob Shaw, CEO of Shaw Industries, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest carpet manufacturer, came to\nsee me with his partner, Julian Saul, and the CEO of a second company with which Shaw was\nmulling a merger.  The potential partner, however, faced huge asbestos liabilities from past\nactivities, and any deal depended on these being eliminated through insurance.\n</p>\n<p>The executives visiting me wanted Berkshire to provide a policy that would pay all future\nasbestos costs.  I explained that though we could write an exceptionally large policy \xe2\x80\x94 far larger\nthan any other insurer would ever think of offering \xe2\x80\x94 we would never issue a policy that lacked\na cap.\n</p>\n<p>Bob and Julian decided that if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bet the ranch on the extent of the acquiree\xe2\x80\x99s\nliability, neither did they.  So their deal died.  But my interest in Shaw was sparked, and a few\nmonths later Charlie and I met with Bob to work out a purchase by Berkshire.  A key feature of\nthe deal was that both Bob and Julian were to continue owning at least 5% of Shaw.  This leaves\nus associated with the best in the business as shown by Bob and Julian\xe2\x80\x99s record: Each built a\nlarge, successful carpet business before joining forces in 1998.\n</p>\n<p>Shaw has annual sales of about $4 billion, and we own 87.3% of the company.  Leaving aside our\ninsurance operation, Shaw is by far our largest business.  Now, if people walk all over us, we\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 In July, Bob Mundheim, a director of Benjamin Moore Paint, called to ask if Berkshire might\nbe interested in acquiring it.  I knew Bob from Salomon, where he was general counsel during\nsome difficult times, and held him in very high regard.  So my answer was \xe2\x80\x9cTell me more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>In late August, Charlie and I met with Richard Roob and Yvan Dupuy, past and present CEOs of\nBenjamin Moore.  We liked them; we liked the business; and we made a $1 billion cash offer on\nthe spot.  In October, their board approved the transaction, and we completed it in December.\nBenjamin Moore has been making paint for 117 years and has thousands of independent dealers\nthat are a vital asset to its business.  Make sure you specify our product for your next paint job.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Finally, in late December, we agreed to buy Johns Manville Corp. for about $1.8 billion.  This\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s incredible odyssey over the last few decades \xef\xa3\xa7 too multifaceted to be chronicled here\n\xef\xa3\xa7 was shaped by its long history as a manufacturer of asbestos products.  The much-publicized\nhealth problems that affected many people exposed to asbestos led to JM\xe2\x80\x99s declaring bankruptcy\nin 1982.\n</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the bankruptcy court established a trust for victims, the major asset of which was a\ncontrolling interest in JM.  The trust, which sensibly wanted to diversify its assets, agreed last\nJune to sell the business to an LBO buyer.  In the end, though, the LBO group was unable to\nobtain financing.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>7\n</p>\n<p>Consequently, the deal was called off on Friday, December 8th.  The following Monday, Charlie\nand I called Bob Felise, chairman of the trust, and made an all-cash offer with no financing\ncontingencies.  The next day the trustees voted tentatively to accept our offer, and a week later we\nsigned a contract.\n</p>\n<p>JM is the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading producer of commercial and industrial insulation and also has major\npositions in roofing systems and a variety of engineered products.  The company\xe2\x80\x99s sales exceed\n$2 billion and the business has earned good, if cyclical, returns.  Jerry Henry, JM\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, had\nannounced his retirement plans a year ago, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report that Charlie and I have\nconvinced him to stick around.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Two economic factors probably contributed to the rush of acquisition activity we experienced last year.\nFirst, many managers and owners foresaw near-term slowdowns in their businesses \xef\xa3\xa7 and, in fact, we purchased\nseveral companies whose earnings will almost certainly decline this year from peaks they reached in 1999 or 2000.\nThe declines make no difference to us, given that we expect all of our businesses to now and then have ups and\ndowns.  (Only in the sales presentations of investment banks do earnings move forever upward.)  We don\xe2\x80\x99t care\nabout the bumps; what matters are the overall results.  But the decisions of other people are sometimes affected by\nthe near-term outlook, which can both spur sellers and temper the enthusiasm of purchasers who might otherwise\ncompete with us.\n</p>\n<p>A second factor that helped us in 2000 was that the market for junk bonds dried up as the year progressed.\nIn the two preceding years, junk bond purchasers had relaxed their standards, buying the obligations of ever-\nweaker issuers at inappropriate prices.  The effects of this laxity were felt last year in a ballooning of defaults.  In\nthis environment, \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial\xe2\x80\x9d buyers of businesses \xef\xa3\xa7 those who wish to buy using only a sliver of equity \xef\xa3\xa7\nbecame unable to borrow all they thought they needed.  What they could still borrow, moreover, came at a high\nprice.  Consequently, LBO operators became less aggressive in their bidding when businesses came up for sale last\nyear.  Because we analyze purchases on an all-equity basis, our evaluations did not change, which means we\nbecame considerably more competitive.\n</p>\n<p>Aside from the economic factors that benefited us, we now enjoy a major and growing advantage in\nmaking acquisitions in that we are often the buyer of choice for the seller.  That fact, of course, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t assure a\ndeal \xef\xa3\xa7 sellers have to like our price, and we have to like their business and management \xef\xa3\xa7 but it does help.\n</p>\n<p>We find it meaningful when an owner cares about whom he sells to.  We like to do business with someone\nwho loves his company, not just the money that a sale will bring him (though we certainly understand why he likes\nthat as well).  When this emotional attachment exists, it signals that important qualities will likely be found within\nthe business: honest accounting, pride of product, respect for customers, and a loyal group of associates having a\nstrong sense of direction.  The reverse is apt to be true, also.  When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a\ntotal lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale, particularly when\nthe seller is a \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial owner.\xe2\x80\x9d  And if owners behave with little regard for their business and its people, their\nconduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.\n</p>\n<p>When a business masterpiece has been created by a lifetime \xe2\x80\x94 or several lifetimes \xe2\x80\x94 of unstinting care\nand exceptional talent, it should be important to the owner what corporation is entrusted to carry on its history.\nCharlie and I believe Berkshire provides an almost unique home.  We take our obligations to the people who\ncreated a business very seriously, and Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s ownership structure ensures that we can fulfill our promises.\nWhen we tell John Justin that his business will remain headquartered in Fort Worth, or assure the Bridge family\nthat its operation will not be merged with another jeweler, these sellers can take those promises to the bank.\n</p>\n<p>How much better it is for the \xe2\x80\x9cpainter\xe2\x80\x9d of a business Rembrandt to personally select its permanent home\nthan to have a trust officer or uninterested heirs auction it off.  Throughout the years we have had great experiences\nwith those who recognize that truth and apply it to their business creations.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the auctions to others.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>8\n</p>\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Our main business \xe2\x80\x94 though we have others of great importance \xe2\x80\x94 is insurance.  To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the\nlong-term outlook for both of these factors.\n</p>\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because\npremiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that\ntime, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside:  The premiums that\nan insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an\n"underwriting loss," which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less\nthan the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is\nhigher than market rates for money.\n</p>\n<p>A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in\nfiguring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company\'s true cost\nof float.  Errors of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these\nmiscalculations flow directly into earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in\nreserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what\'s presented, and at times I have been\namazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed.  Both the income statements and balance\nsheets of insurers can be minefields.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, we strive to be both consistent and conservative in our reserving.  But we will make\nmistakes.  And we warn you that there is nothing symmetrical about surprises in the insurance business: They\nalmost always are unpleasant.\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\ninsurance operations since we entered the business 34 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company\n(whose traditional lines are included in the segment \xe2\x80\x9cOther Primary\xe2\x80\x9d).  For the table we have calculated our float\n\xe2\x80\x94 which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \xe2\x80\x94 by adding net loss reserves, loss\nadjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting\ninsurance-related receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed\nreinsurance.  (Don\xe2\x80\x99t panic, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a quiz.)\n</p>\n<p>Yearend Float (in $ millions)\n</p>\n<p>Other Other\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n</p>\n<p>1967 20 20\n1977 40 131 171\n1987 701 807 1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\n</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased by the growth in our float during 2000 but not happy with its cost.  Over the years, our cost\nof float has been very close to zero, with the underwriting profits realized in most years offsetting the occasional\nterrible year such as 1984, when our cost was a staggering 19%.  In 2000, however, we had an underwriting loss of\n$1.6 billion, which gave us a float cost of 6%.  Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect our float cost to fall in 2001\n\xef\xa3\xa7 perhaps substantially \xef\xa3\xa7 in large part because of corrections in pricing at General Re that should increasingly be\nfelt as the year progresses.  On a smaller scale, GEICO may experience the same improving trend.\n</p>\n<p>There are two factors affecting our cost of float that are very rare at other insurers but that now loom large\nat Berkshire.  First, a few insurers that are currently experiencing large losses have offloaded a significant portion of</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>9\n</p>\n<p>these on us in a manner that penalizes our current earnings but gives us float we can use for many years to come.\nAfter the loss that we incur in the first year of the policy, there are no further costs attached to this business.\n</p>\n<p>When these policies are properly priced, we welcome the pain-today, gain-tomorrow effects they have.  In\n1999, $400 million of our underwriting loss (about 27.8% of the total) came from business of this kind and in 2000\nthe figure was $482 million (34.4% of our loss).  We have no way of predicting how much similar business we will\nwrite in the future, but what we do get will typically be in large chunks.  Because these transactions can materially\ndistort our figures, we will tell you about them as they occur.\n</p>\n<p>Other reinsurers have little taste for this insurance.  They simply can\xe2\x80\x99t stomach what huge underwriting\nlosses do to their reported results, even though these losses are produced by policies whose overall economics are\ncertain to be favorable.  You should be careful, therefore, in comparing our underwriting results with those of other\ninsurers.\n</p>\n<p>An even more significant item in our numbers \xe2\x80\x94 which, again, you won\xe2\x80\x99t find much of elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94\narises from transactions in which we assume past losses of a company that wants to put its troubles behind it.  To\nillustrate, the XYZ insurance company might have last year bought a policy obligating us to pay the first $1 billion\nof losses and loss adjustment expenses from events that happened in, say, 1995 and earlier years.  These contracts\ncan be very large, though we always require a cap on our exposure.  We entered into a number of such transactions\nin 2000 and expect to close several more in 2001.\n</p>\n<p>Under GAAP accounting, this \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive\xe2\x80\x9d insurance neither benefits nor penalizes our current earnings.\nInstead, we set up an asset called \xe2\x80\x9cdeferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance,\xe2\x80\x9d in an amount reflecting\nthe difference between the premium we receive and the (higher) losses we expect to pay (for which reserves are\nimmediately established).  We then amortize this asset by making annual charges to earnings that create equivalent\nunderwriting losses.  You will find the amount of the loss that we incur from these transactions in both our\nquarterly and annual management discussion.  By their nature, these losses will continue for many years, often\nstretching into decades.  As an offset, though, we have the use of float \xef\xa3\xa7 lots of it.\n</p>\n<p>Clearly, float carrying an annual cost of this kind is not as desirable as float we generate from policies that\nare expected to produce an underwriting profit (of which we have plenty).  Nevertheless, this retroactive insurance\nshould be decent business for us.\n</p>\n<p>The net of all this is that a) I expect our cost of float to be very attractive in the future but b) rarely to\nreturn to a \xe2\x80\x9cno-cost\xe2\x80\x9d mode because of the annual charge that retroactive reinsurance will lay on us.  Also \xe2\x80\x94\nobviously \xef\xa3\xa7 the ultimate benefits that we derive from float will depend not only on its cost but, fully as important,\nhow effectively we deploy it.\n</p>\n<p>Our retroactive business is almost single-handedly the work of Ajit Jain, whose praises I sing annually.  It\nis impossible to overstate how valuable Ajit is to Berkshire.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about my health; worry about his.\n</p>\n<p>Last year, Ajit brought home a $2.4 billion reinsurance premium, perhaps the largest in history, from a\npolicy that retroactively covers a major U.K. company.  Subsequently, he wrote a large policy protecting the Texas\nRangers from the possibility that Alex Rodriguez will become permanently disabled.  As sports fans know, \xe2\x80\x9cA-Rod\xe2\x80\x9d\nwas signed for $252 million, a record, and we think that our policy probably also set a record for disability\ninsurance.  We cover many other sports figures as well.\n</p>\n<p>In another example of his versatility, Ajit last fall negotiated a very interesting deal with Grab.com, an\nInternet company whose goal was to attract millions of people to its site and there to extract information from them\nthat would be useful to marketers.  To lure these people, Grab.com held out the possibility of a $1 billion prize\n(having a $170 million present value) and we insured its payment.  A message on the site explained that the\nchance of anyone winning the prize was low, and indeed no one won.  But the possibility of a win was far from nil.\n</p>\n<p>Writing such a policy, we receive a modest premium, face the possibility of a huge loss, and get good\nodds. Very few insurers like that equation.  And they\xe2\x80\x99re unable to cure their unhappiness by reinsurance.  Because\neach policy has unusual \xef\xa3\xa7 and sometimes unique \xef\xa3\xa7 characteristics, insurers can\xe2\x80\x99t lay off the occasional shock loss</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>10\n</p>\n<p>through their standard reinsurance arrangements.  Therefore, any insurance CEO doing a piece of business like this\nmust run the small, but real, risk of a horrible quarterly earnings number, one that he would not enjoy explaining to\nhis board or shareholders.  Charlie and I, however, like any proposition that makes compelling mathematical sense,\nregardless of its effect on reported earnings.\n</p>\n<p>At General Re, the news has turned considerably better:  Ron Ferguson, along with Joe Brandon, Tad\nMontross, and a talented supporting cast took many actions during 2000 to bring that company\xe2\x80\x99s profitability back\nto past standards.  Though our pricing is not fully corrected, we have significantly repriced business that was\nseverely unprofitable or dropped it altogether.  If there\xe2\x80\x99s no mega-catastrophe in 2001, General Re\xe2\x80\x99s float cost\nshould fall materially.\n</p>\n<p>The last couple of years haven\xe2\x80\x99t been any fun for Ron and his crew.  But they have stepped up to tough\ndecisions, and Charlie and I applaud them for these.  General Re has several important and enduring business\nadvantages.  Better yet, it has managers who will make the most of them.\n</p>\n<p>In aggregate, our smaller insurance operations produced an excellent underwriting profit in 2000 while\ngenerating significant float \xe2\x80\x94 just as they have done for more than a decade.  If these companies were a single and\nseparate operation, people would consider it an outstanding insurer.  Because the companies instead reside in an\nenterprise as large as Berkshire, the world may not appreciate their accomplishments \xe2\x80\x94 but I sure do.  Last year I\nthanked Rod Eldred, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster, and I again do so.  In addition, we now also owe\nthanks to Tom Nerney at U.S. Liability and Michael Stearns, the new head of Cypress.\n</p>\n<p>You may notice that Brad Kinstler, who was CEO of Cypress and whose praises I\xe2\x80\x99ve sung in the past, is no\nlonger in the list above.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because we needed a new manager at Fechheimer Bros., our Cincinnati-based\nuniform company, and called on Brad.  We seldom move Berkshire managers from one enterprise to another, but\nmaybe we should try it more often:  Brad is hitting home runs in his new job, just as he always did at Cypress.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO (1-800-847-7536 or GEICO.com)\n</p>\n<p>We show below the usual table detailing GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s growth.  Last year I enthusiastically told you that we\nwould step up our expenditures on advertising in 2000 and that the added dollars were the best investment that\nGEICO could make.  I was wrong:  The extra money we spent did not produce a commensurate increase in\ninquiries.  Additionally, the percentage of inquiries that we converted into sales fell for the first time in many\nyears.  These negative developments combined to produce a sharp increase in our per-policy acquisition cost.\n</p>\n<p>New Auto Auto Policies\nYears Policies(1) In-Force(1)\n</p>\n<p>1993 346,882 2,011,055\n1994 384,217 2,147,549\n1995 443,539 2,310,037\n1996 592,300 2,543,699\n1997 868,430 2,949,439\n1998 1,249,875 3,562,644\n1999 1,648,095 4,328,900\n2000 1,472,853 4,696,842\n</p>\n<p>(1)  \xe2\x80\x9cVoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d only; excludes assigned risks and the like.\n</p>\n<p>Agonizing over errors is a mistake.  But acknowledging and analyzing them can be useful, though that\npractice is rare in corporate boardrooms.  There, Charlie and I have almost never witnessed a candid post-mortem of\na failed decision, particularly one involving an acquisition.  A notable exception to this never-look-back approach is\nthat of The Washington Post Company, which unfailingly and objectively reviews its acquisitions three years after\nthey are made.  Elsewhere, triumphs are trumpeted, but dumb decisions either get no follow-up or are rationalized.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>11\n</p>\n<p>The financial consequences of these boners are regularly dumped into massive restructuring charges or\nwrite-offs that are casually waved off as \xe2\x80\x9cnonrecurring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Managements just love these.  Indeed, in recent years it\nhas seemed that no earnings statement is complete without them.  The origins of these charges, though, are never\nexplored.  When it comes to corporate blunders, CEOs invoke the concept of the Virgin Birth.\n</p>\n<p>To get back to our examination of GEICO:  There are at least four factors that could account for the\nincreased costs we experienced in obtaining new business last year, and all probably contributed in some manner.\n</p>\n<p>First, in our advertising we have pushed \xe2\x80\x9cfrequency\xe2\x80\x9d very hard, and we probably overstepped in certain\nmedia.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve always known that increasing the number of messages through any medium would eventually\nproduce diminishing returns.  The third ad in an hour on a given cable channel is simply not going to be as effective\nas the first.\n</p>\n<p>Second, we may have already picked much of the low-hanging fruit.  Clearly, the willingness to do\nbusiness with a direct marketer of insurance varies widely among individuals:  Indeed, some percentage of\nAmericans \xef\xa3\xa7 particularly older ones \xef\xa3\xa7 are reluctant to make direct purchases of any kind.  Over the years,\nhowever, this reluctance will ebb.  A new generation with new habits will find the savings from direct purchase of\ntheir auto insurance too compelling to ignore.\n</p>\n<p>Another factor that surely decreased the conversion of inquiries into sales was stricter underwriting by\nGEICO.  Both the frequency and severity of losses increased during the year, and rates in certain areas became\ninadequate, in some cases substantially so. In these instances, we necessarily tightened our underwriting standards.\nThis tightening, as well as the many rate increases we put in during the year, made our offerings less attractive to\nsome prospects.\n</p>\n<p>A high percentage of callers, it should be emphasized, can still save money by insuring with us.\nUnderstandably, however, some prospects will switch to save $200 per year but will not switch to save $50.\nTherefore, rate increases that bring our prices closer to those of our competitors will hurt our acceptance rate, even\nwhen we continue to offer the best deal.\n</p>\n<p>Finally, the competitive picture changed in at least one important respect:  State Farm \xef\xa3\xa7 by far the largest\npersonal auto insurer, with about 19% of the market \xe2\x80\x94 has been very slow to raise prices.  Its costs, however, are\nclearly increasing right along with those of the rest of the industry.  Consequently, State Farm had an underwriting\nloss last year from auto insurance (including rebates to policyholders) of 18% of premiums, compared to 4% at\nGEICO.  Our loss produced a float cost for us of 6.1%, an unsatisfactory result.  (Indeed, at GEICO we expect float,\nover time, to be free.)  But we estimate that State Farm\xe2\x80\x99s float cost in 2000 was about 23%.  The willingness of the\nlargest player in the industry to tolerate such a cost makes the economics difficult for other participants.\n</p>\n<p>That does not take away from the fact that State Farm is one of America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest business stories.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nurged that the company be studied at business schools because it has achieved fabulous success while following a\npath that in many ways defies the dogma of those institutions.  Studying counter-evidence is a highly useful activity,\nthough not one always greeted with enthusiasm at citadels of learning.\n</p>\n<p>State Farm was launched in 1922, by a 45-year-old, semi-retired Illinois farmer, to compete with long-\nestablished insurers \xef\xa3\xa7 haughty institutions in New York, Philadelphia and Hartford \xef\xa3\xa7 that possessed\noverwhelming advantages in capital, reputation, and distribution.  Because State Farm is a mutual company, its\nboard members and managers could not be owners, and it had no access to capital markets during its years of fast\ngrowth.  Similarly, the business never had the stock options or lavish salaries that many people think vital if an\nAmerican enterprise is to attract able managers and thrive.\n</p>\n<p>In the end, however, State Farm eclipsed all its competitors.  In fact, by 1999 the company had amassed a\ntangible net worth exceeding that of all but four American businesses.  If you want to read how this happened, get a\ncopy of The Farmer from Merna.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>12\n</p>\n<p>Despite State Farm\xe2\x80\x99s strengths, however, GEICO has much the better business model, one that embodies\nsignificantly lower operating costs.  And, when a company is selling a product with commodity-like economic\ncharacteristics, being the low-cost producer is all-important.  This enduring competitive advantage of GEICO \xef\xa3\xa7\none it possessed in 1951 when, as a 20-year-old student, I first became enamored with its stock \xef\xa3\xa7 is the reason that\nover time it will inevitably increase its market share significantly while simultaneously achieving excellent profits.\nOur growth will be slow, however, if State Farm elects to continue bearing the underwriting losses that it is now\nsuffering.\n</p>\n<p>Tony Nicely, GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, remains an owner\xe2\x80\x99s dream.  Everything he does makes sense.  He never\nengages in wishful thinking or otherwise distorts reality, as so many managers do when the unexpected happens.  As\n2000 unfolded, Tony cut back on advertising that was not cost-effective, and he will continue to do that in 2001 if\ncutbacks are called for (though we will always maintain a massive media presence).  Tony has also aggressively\nfiled for price increases where we need them.  He looks at the loss reports every day and is never behind the curve.\nTo steal a line from a competitor, we are in good hands with Tony.\n</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you about our profit-sharing arrangement at GEICO that targets only two variables \xe2\x80\x94 growth in\npolicies and the underwriting results of seasoned business.  Despite the headwinds of 2000, we still had a\nperformance that produced an 8.8% profit-sharing payment, amounting to $40.7 million.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will be a huge part of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s future.  Because of its rock-bottom operating costs, it offers a\ngreat many Americans the cheapest way to purchase a high-ticket product that they must buy.  The company then\ncouples this bargain with service that consistently ranks high in independent surveys.  That\xe2\x80\x99s a combination\ninevitably producing growth and profitability.\n</p>\n<p>In just the last few years, far more drivers have learned to associate the GEICO brand with saving money\non their insurance.  We will pound that theme relentlessly until all Americans are aware of the value that we offer.\n</p>\n<p>Investments\n</p>\n<p>Below we present our common stock investments.

There are no \xe2\x80\x9cbargains\xe2\x80\x9d\namong our current holdings:  We\xe2\x80\x99re content with what we own but far from excited by it.\n</p>\n<p>Many people assume that marketable securities are Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s first choice when allocating capital, but\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not true: Ever since we first published our economic principles in 1983, we have consistently stated that we\nwould rather purchase businesses than stocks.  (See number 4 on page 60.)  One reason for that preference is\npersonal, in that I love working with our managers.  They are high-grade, talented and loyal.  And, frankly, I find\ntheir business behavior to be more rational and owner-oriented than that prevailing at many public companies.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>13\n</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s also a powerful financial reason behind the preference, and that has to do with taxes.  The tax\ncode makes Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s owning 80% or more of a business far more profitable for us, proportionately, than our\nowning a smaller share.  When a company we own all of earns $1 million after tax, the entire amount inures to our\nbenefit.  If the $1 million is upstreamed to Berkshire, we owe no tax on the dividend.  And, if the earnings are\nretained and we were to sell the subsidiary \xef\xa3\xa7 not likely at Berkshire! \xef\xa3\xa7 for $1million more than we paid for it, we\nwould owe no capital gains tax.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because our \xe2\x80\x9ctax cost\xe2\x80\x9d upon sale would include both what we paid for the\nbusiness and all earnings it subsequently retained.\n</p>\n<p>Contrast that situation to what happens when we own an investment in a marketable security.  There, if we\nown a 10% stake in a business earning $10 million after tax, our $1 million share of the earnings is subject to\nadditional state and federal taxes of (1) about $140,000 if it is distributed to us (our tax rate on most dividends is\n14%); or (2) no less than $350,000 if the $1 million is retained and subsequently captured by us in the form of a\ncapital gain (on which our tax rate is usually about 35%, though it sometimes approaches 40%).  We may defer\npaying the $350,000 by not immediately realizing our gain, but eventually we must pay the tax.  In effect, the\ngovernment is our \xe2\x80\x9cpartner\xe2\x80\x9d twice when we own part of a business through a stock investment, but only once when\nwe own at least 80%.\n</p>\n<p>Leaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical.  Indeed, the\nformula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by\na very smart man in about 600 B.C.  (though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).\n</p>\n<p>The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was \xe2\x80\x9ca bird in\nthe hand is worth two in the bush.\xe2\x80\x9d  To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions.  How certain\nare you that there are indeed birds in the bush?  When will they emerge and how many will there be?  What is the\nrisk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)?  If you can answer these three\nquestions, you will know the maximum value of the bush \xef\xa3\xa7 and the maximum number of the birds you now\npossess that should be offered for it.  And, of course, don\xe2\x80\x99t literally think birds.  Think dollars.\n</p>\n<p>Aesop\xe2\x80\x99s investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into dollars, is immutable.  It applies to outlays\nfor farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants.  And neither the advent of the steam\nengine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota \xe2\x80\x94 nor will the\nInternet.  Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital\nthroughout the universe.\n</p>\n<p>Common yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or to book value, and even growth\nrates have nothing to do with valuation except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash\nflows into and from the business.  Indeed, growth can destroy value if it requires cash inputs in the early years of a\nproject or enterprise that exceed the discounted value of the cash that those assets will generate in later years.\nMarket commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to \xe2\x80\x9cgrowth\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d styles as contrasting\napproaches to investment are displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication.  Growth is simply a component \xef\xa3\xa7\nusually a plus, sometimes a minus \xef\xa3\xa7 in the value equation.\n</p>\n<p>Alas, though Aesop\xe2\x80\x99s proposition and the third variable \xef\xa3\xa7 that is, interest rates \xef\xa3\xa7 are simple, plugging in\nnumbers for the other two variables is a difficult task.  Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a\nrange of possibilities is the better approach.\n</p>\n<p>Usually, the range must be so wide that no useful conclusion can be reached.  Occasionally, though, even\nvery conservative estimates about the future emergence of birds reveal that the price quoted is startlingly low in\nrelation to value.  (Let\xe2\x80\x99s call this phenomenon the IBT \xef\xa3\xa7 Inefficient Bush Theory.)  To be sure, an investor needs\nsome general understanding of business economics as well as the ability to think independently to reach a well-\nfounded positive conclusion.  But the investor does not need brilliance nor blinding insights.\n</p>\n<p>At the other extreme, there are many times when the most brilliant of investors can\xe2\x80\x99t muster a conviction\nabout the birds to emerge, not even when a very broad range of estimates is employed.  This kind of uncertainty\nfrequently occurs when new businesses and rapidly changing industries are under examination.  In cases of this sort,\nany capital commitment must be labeled speculative.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>14\n</p>\n<p>Now, speculation \xe2\x80\x94 in which the focus is not on what an asset will produce but rather on what the next\nfellow will pay for it \xe2\x80\x94 is neither illegal, immoral nor un-American.  But it is not a game in which Charlie and I\nwish to play.  We bring nothing to the party, so why should we expect to take anything home?\n</p>\n<p>The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still\nfurther when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs.  Nothing sedates rationality like large doses\nof effortless money.  After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that\nof Cinderella at the ball.  They know that overstaying the festivities \xef\xa3\xa7 that is, continuing to speculate in companies\nthat have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future \xef\xa3\xa7 will eventually bring on\npumpkins and mice.  But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party.  Therefore, the\ngiddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a problem, though: They are dancing in\na room in which the clocks have no hands.\n</p>\n<p>Last year, we commented on the exuberance \xef\xa3\xa7 and, yes, it was irrational \xef\xa3\xa7 that prevailed, noting that\ninvestor expectations had grown to be several multiples of probable returns.  One piece of evidence came from a\nPaine Webber-Gallup survey of investors conducted in December 1999, in which the participants were asked their\nopinion about the annual returns investors could expect to realize over the decade ahead.  Their answers averaged\n19%.  That, for sure, was an irrational expectation:  For American business as a whole, there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be\nenough birds in the 2009 bush to deliver such a return.\n</p>\n<p>Far more irrational still were the huge valuations that market participants were then putting on businesses\nalmost certain to end up being of modest or no value.  Yet investors, mesmerized by soaring stock prices and\nignoring all else, piled into these enterprises.  It was as if some virus, racing wildly among investment professionals\nas well as amateurs, induced hallucinations in which the values of stocks in certain sectors became decoupled from\nthe values of the businesses that underlay them.\n</p>\n<p>This surreal scene was accompanied by much loose talk about \xe2\x80\x9cvalue creation.\xe2\x80\x9d  We readily acknowledge\nthat there has been a huge amount of true value created in the past decade by new or young businesses, and that\nthere is much more to come.  But value is destroyed, not created, by any business that loses money over its lifetime,\nno matter how high its interim valuation may get.\n</p>\n<p>What actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer, often on a massive scale.  By shamelessly\nmerchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the\npublic to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates).  The fact is that a bubble market has allowed\nthe creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for\nthem.  Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company\xe2\x80\x99s promoters.  At bottom, the \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\nmodel\xe2\x80\x9d for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers\nacted as eager postmen.\n</p>\n<p>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble.  And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns\nsome very old lessons:  First, many in Wall Street \xef\xa3\xa7 a community in which quality control is not prized \xef\xa3\xa7 will sell\ninvestors anything they will buy.  Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, we make no attempt to pick the few winners that will emerge from an ocean of unproven\nenterprises.  We\xe2\x80\x99re not smart enough to do that, and we know it.  Instead, we try to apply Aesop\xe2\x80\x99s 2,600-year-old\nequation to opportunities in which we have reasonable confidence as to how many birds are in the bush and when\nthey will emerge  (a formulation that my grandsons would probably update to \xe2\x80\x9cA girl in a convertible is worth five\nin the phonebook.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Obviously, we can never precisely predict the timing of cash flows in and out of a business or\ntheir exact amount.  We try, therefore, to keep our estimates conservative and to focus on industries where business\nsurprises are unlikely to wreak havoc on owners.  Even so, we make many mistakes:  I\xe2\x80\x99m the fellow, remember,\nwho thought he understood the future economics of trading stamps, textiles, shoes and second-tier department\nstores.\n</p>\n<p>Lately, the most promising \xe2\x80\x9cbushes\xe2\x80\x9d have been negotiated transactions for entire businesses, and that\npleases us.  You should clearly understand, however, that these acquisitions will at best provide us only reasonable\nreturns.  Really juicy results from negotiated deals can be anticipated only when capital markets are severely\nconstrained and the whole business world is pessimistic.  We are 180 degrees from that point.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>15\n</p>\n<p>Sources of Reported Earnings\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire\'s reported earnings.

For the reasons discussed on page 65, this form of presentation seems to\nus to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),\nwhich require purchase-premiums to be charged off business-by-business.

In our shoe businesses generally, our attempt to keep the\nbulk of our production in domestic factories has cost us dearly.  We face another very tough year in 2001 also, as\nwe make significant changes in how we do business.\n</p>\n<p>I clearly made a mistake in paying what I did for Dexter in 1993.  Furthermore, I compounded that\nmistake in a huge way by using Berkshire shares in payment.  Last year, to recognize my error, we charged off all\nthe remaining accounting goodwill that was attributable to the Dexter transaction.  We may regain some economic\ngoodwill at Dexter in the future, but we clearly have none at present.\n</p>\n<p>The managers of our shoe businesses are first-class from both a business and human perspective.

Both\ncompanies are run by their remarkable founders.\n</p>\n<p>Al Ueltschi at FSI is now 83 and continues to operate at full throttle.  Though I am not a fan of stock splits,\nI am planning to split Al\xe2\x80\x99s age 2-for-1 when he hits 100.  (If it works, guess who\xe2\x80\x99s next.)\n</p>\n<p>We spent $272 million on flight simulators in 2000, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a similar amount this year.  Anyone\nwho thinks that the annual charges for depreciation don\xe2\x80\x99t reflect a real cost \xef\xa3\xa7 every bit as real as payroll or raw\nmaterials \xef\xa3\xa7 should get an internship at a simulator company.  Every year we spend amounts equal to our\ndepreciation charge simply to stay in the same economic place \xef\xa3\xa7 and then spend additional sums to grow.  And\ngrowth is in prospect for FSI as far as the eye can see.\n</p>\n<p>Even faster growth awaits EJA (whose fractional-ownership program is called NetJets\xef\xa3\xa8).  Rich Santulli is\nthe dynamo behind this business.\n</p>\n<p>Last year I told you that EJA\xe2\x80\x99s recurring revenue from monthly management fees and hourly usage grew\nby 46% in 1999.  In 2000 the growth was 49%.  I also told you that this was a low-margin business, in which\nsurvivors will be few.  Margins were indeed slim at EJA last year, in part because of the major costs we are\nincurring in developing our business in Europe.\n</p>\n<p>Regardless of the cost, you can be sure that EJA\xe2\x80\x99s spending on safety will be whatever is needed.\nObviously, we would follow this policy under any circumstances, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some self-interest here as well:  I, my\nwife, my children, my sisters, my 94-year-old aunt, all but one of our directors, and at least nine Berkshire managers\nregularly fly in the NetJets program.  Given that cargo, I applaud Rich\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on unusually high amounts of\npilot training (an average of 23 days a year).  In addition, our pilots cement their skills by flying 800 or so hours a\nyear.  Finally, each flies only one model of aircraft, which means our crews do no switching around among planes\nwith different cockpit and flight characteristics.\n</p>\n<p>EJA\xe2\x80\x99s business continues to be constrained by the availability of new aircraft.  Still, our customers will\ntake delivery of more than 50 new jets in 2001, 7% of world output.  We are confident we will remain the world\nleader in fractional ownership, in respect to number of planes flying, quality of service, and standards of safety.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Additional information about our various businesses is given on pages 42-58, where you will also find our\nsegment earnings reported on a GAAP basis.  In addition, on pages 67-73, we have rearranged Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s financial\ndata into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds to the way Charlie and I think about\nthe company.\n</p>\n<p>Look-Through Earnings\n</p>\n<p>Reported earnings are an inadequate measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the\nnumbers shown in the table on page 15 include only the dividends we receive from investees \xef\xa3\xa7 though these\ndividends typically represent only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership.  To depict\nsomething closer to economic reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the concept of "look-\nthrough" earnings.  As we calculate these, they consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported on page 15; plus; (2)\nour share of the retained operating earnings of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in\nour profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees\nhad instead been distributed to us.  When tabulating "operating earnings" here, we exclude purchase-accounting\nadjustments as well as capital gains and other major non-recurring items.\n</p>\n<p>The following table sets forth our 2000 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can be no\nmore than approximate, since they are based on a number of judgment calls.  (The dividends paid to us by these\ninvestees have been included in the operating earnings itemized on page 15, mostly under "Insurance Group:  Net\nInvestment Income.")</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>17\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\'s Approximate Berkshire\'s Share of Undistributed\nBerkshire\'s Major Investees  Ownership at Yearend(1)  Operating Earnings (in millions)(2)  \nAmerican Express Company ............................. 11.4% $265\nThe Coca-Cola Company ..................................    8.1%   160\nFreddie Mac .....................................................   0.3%   106\nThe Gillette Company.......................................   9.1%     51\nM&amp;T Bank .......................................................   7.2%     23\nThe Washington Post Company ........................ 18.3%     18\nWells Fargo &amp; Company...................................   3.2%   117\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\'s share of undistributed earnings of major investees 740\nHypothetical tax on these undistributed investee earnings(3)    (104)\nReported operating earnings of Berkshire  1,779  \n      Total look-through earnings of Berkshire $ 2,415  \n</p>\n<p>     (1) Does not include shares allocable to minority interests\n     (2) Calculated on average ownership for the year\n     (3) The tax rate used is 14%, which is the rate Berkshire pays on most dividends it receives\n</p>\n<p>Full and Fair Reporting \n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, full reporting means giving you the information that we would wish you to give to us if our\npositions were reversed.  What Charlie and I would want under that circumstance would be all the important facts\nabout current operations as well as the CEO\xe2\x80\x99s frank view of the long-term economic characteristics of the business.\nWe would expect both a lot of financial details and a discussion of any significant data we would need to interpret\nwhat was presented.\n</p>\n<p>When Charlie and I read reports, we have no interest in pictures of personnel, plants or products.\nReferences to EBITDA make us shudder  \xef\xa3\xa7 does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re very suspicious of accounting methodology that is vague or unclear, since too often that means management\nwishes to hide something.  And we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read messages that a public relations department or consultant has\nturned out.  Instead, we expect a company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO to explain in his or her own words what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\n</p>\n<p>For us, fair reporting means getting information to our 300,000 \xe2\x80\x9cpartners\xe2\x80\x9d simultaneously, or as close to\nthat mark as possible.  We therefore put our annual and quarterly financials on the Internet between the close of the\nmarket on a Friday and the following morning.  By our doing that, shareholders and other interested investors have\ntimely access to these important releases and also have a reasonable amount of time to digest the information they\ninclude before the markets open on Monday.  This year our quarterly information will be available on the Saturdays\nof May 12, August 11, and November 10.  The 2001 annual report will be posted on March 9.\n</p>\n<p>We applaud the work that Arthur Levitt, Jr., until recently Chairman of the SEC, has done in cracking\ndown on the corporate practice of \xe2\x80\x9cselective disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d that had spread like cancer in recent years.  Indeed, it had\nbecome virtually standard practice for major corporations to \xe2\x80\x9cguide\xe2\x80\x9d analysts or large holders to earnings\nexpectations that were intended either to be on the nose or a tiny bit below what the company truly expected to earn.\nThrough the selectively dispersed hints, winks and nods that companies engaged in, speculatively-minded\ninstitutions and advisors were given an information edge over investment-oriented individuals.  This was corrupt\nbehavior, unfortunately embraced by both Wall Street and corporate America.\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to Chairman Levitt, whose general efforts on behalf of investors were both tireless and effective,\ncorporations are now required to treat all of their owners equally.  The fact that this reform came about because of\ncoercion rather than conscience should be a matter of shame for CEOs and their investor relations departments.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>18\n</p>\n<p>One further thought while I\xe2\x80\x99m on my soapbox: Charlie and I think it is both deceptive and dangerous for\nCEOs to predict growth rates for their companies.  They are, of course, frequently egged on to do so by both\nanalysts and their own investor relations departments.  They should resist, however, because too often these\npredictions lead to trouble.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s fine for a CEO to have his own internal goals and, in our view, it\xe2\x80\x99s even appropriate for the CEO to\npublicly express some hopes about the future, if these expectations are accompanied by sensible caveats.  But for a\nmajor corporation to predict that its per-share earnings will grow over the long term at, say, 15% annually is to court\ntrouble.\n</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s true because a growth rate of that magnitude can only be maintained by a very small percentage of\nlarge businesses.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s a test:  Examine the record of, say, the 200 highest earning companies from 1970 or 1980\nand tabulate how many have increased per-share earnings by 15% annually since those dates.  You will find that\nonly a handful have.  I would wager you a very significant sum that fewer than 10 of the 200 most profitable\ncompanies in 2000 will attain 15% annual growth in earnings-per-share over the next 20 years.\n</p>\n<p>The problem arising from lofty predictions is not just that they spread unwarranted optimism.  Even more\ntroublesome is the fact that they corrode CEO behavior.  Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many\ninstances in which CEOs engaged in uneconomic operating maneuvers so that they could meet earnings targets they\nhad announced.  Worse still, after exhausting all that operating acrobatics would do, they sometimes played a wide\nvariety of accounting games to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d These accounting shenanigans have a way of snowballing:\nOnce a company moves earnings from one period to another, operating shortfalls that occur thereafter require it to\nengage in further accounting maneuvers that must be even more \xe2\x80\x9cheroic.\xe2\x80\x9d  These can turn fudging into fraud.\n(More money, it has been noted, has been stolen with the point of a pen than at the point of a gun.)\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I tend to be leery of companies run by CEOs who woo investors with fancy predictions.  A few\nof these managers will prove prophetic \xe2\x80\x94 but others will turn out to be congenital optimists, or even charlatans.\nUnfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for investors to know in advance which species they are dealing with.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve warned you in the past that you should not believe everything you read or hear about Berkshire \xef\xa3\xa7\neven when it is published or broadcast by a prestigious news organization.  Indeed, erroneous reports are\nparticularly dangerous when they are circulated by highly-respected members of the media, simply because most\nreaders and listeners know these outlets to be generally credible and therefore believe what they say.\n</p>\n<p>An example is a glaring error about Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s activities that appeared in the December 29 issue of The\nWall Street Journal, a generally excellent paper that I have for all of my life found useful.  On the front page (and\nabove the fold, as they say) The Journal published a news brief that said, in unequivocal terms, that we were buying\nbonds of Conseco and Finova.  This item directed the reader to the lead story of the Money and Investing section.\nThere, in the second paragraph of the story, The Journal reported, again without any qualification, that Berkshire\nwas buying Conseco and Finova bonds, adding that Berkshire had invested \xe2\x80\x9cseveral hundred million dollars\xe2\x80\x9d in\neach.  Only in the 18th paragraph of the story (which by that point had jumped to an inside page) did the paper hedge\na bit, saying that our Conseco purchases had been disclosed by \xe2\x80\x9cpeople familiar with the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Well, not that familiar.  True, we had purchased bonds and bank debt of Finova \xef\xa3\xa7 though the report was\nwildly inaccurate as to the amount.  But to this day neither Berkshire nor I have ever bought a share of stock or a\nbond of Conseco.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire is normally covered by a Journal reporter in Chicago who is both accurate and conscientious.  In\nthis case, however, the \xe2\x80\x9cscoop\xe2\x80\x9d was the product of a New York reporter for the paper.  Indeed, the 29th was a busy\nday for him:  By early afternoon, he had repeated the story on CNBC.  Immediately, in lemming-like manner, other\nrespected news organizations, relying solely on the Journal, began relating the same \xe2\x80\x9cfacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  The result:  Conseco\nstock advanced sharply during the day on exceptional volume that placed it ninth on the NYSE most-active list.\n</p>\n<p>During all of the story\xe2\x80\x99s iterations, I never heard or read the word \xe2\x80\x9crumor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Apparently reporters and\neditors, who generally pride themselves on their careful use of language, just can\xe2\x80\x99t bring themselves to attach this\nword to their accounts.  But what description would fit more precisely?  Certainly not the usual \xe2\x80\x9csources say\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cit\nhas been reported.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>19\n</p>\n<p>A column entitled \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s Rumors,\xe2\x80\x9d however, would not equate with the self-image of the many news\norganizations that think themselves above such stuff.  These members of the media would feel that publishing such\nacknowledged fluff would be akin to L\xe2\x80\x99Osservatore Romano initiating a gossip column.  But rumors are what these\norganizations often publish and broadcast, whatever euphemism they duck behind.  At a minimum, readers deserve\nhonest terminology \xef\xa3\xa7 a warning label that will protect their financial health in the same way that smokers whose\nphysical health is at risk are given a warning.\n</p>\n<p>The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment allows the media to print or say almost anything.

We are pleased that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has since gone to an alternative\napproach that strikes us as very sound.\n</p>\n<p>If the proposed rule becomes final, we will no longer incur a large annual charge for amortization of\nintangibles.  Consequently, our reported earnings will more closely reflect economic reality.  (See page 65.)  None\nof this will have an effect on Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value.

Under\nhis leadership, the company distributed $1.03 billion to Berkshire against our net purchase price of $230 million.\nWe used these funds, in turn, to purchase other businesses.

But my results were no\nbetter than average.\n</p>\n<p>Beginning in 1951 my performance improved.  No, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t changed my diet or taken up exercise.  The\nonly new ingredient was Ben\xe2\x80\x99s ideas.  Quite simply, a few hours spent at the feet of the master proved far more\nvaluable to me than had ten years of supposedly original thinking.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to being a great teacher, Ben was a wonderful friend.  My debt to him is incalculable.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>20\n</p>\n<p>Shareholder-Designated Contributions\n</p>\n<p>About 97% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire\'s 2000 shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram, with contributions totaling $16.9 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 74-75.\n</p>\n<p>Cumulatively, over the 20 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $164 million\npursuant to the instructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire\'s giving is done by our subsidiaries, which\nstick to the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners\nthemselves take on the responsibility for their personal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions\nof $18.3 million in 2000, including in-kind donations of $3 million.\n</p>\n<p>To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the\nactual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 2001\nwill be ineligible for the 2001 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it\ndoes not get put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored.\n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>Last year we moved the annual meeting to the Civic Auditorium, and it worked very well for us.  We will\nmeet there again on Saturday, April 28.  The doors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting\nitself will commence at 9:30.  There will be a short break at noon for food, with sandwiches available at the Civic\xe2\x80\x99s\nconcession stands.  Except for that interlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.\n</p>\n<p>For the next couple of years, the Civic is our only choice.  We must therefore hold the meeting on either\nSaturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare that would occur on a weekday.  Shortly, however,\nOmaha will have a new Convention Center with ample parking.  Assuming that the Center is then available to us, I\nwill poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to a Monday meeting.  We will decide that vote based on\nthe wishes of a majority of shareholders, not shares.\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to this year\xe2\x80\x99s meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal\nfashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting.  After the meeting, the buses will make trips back\nto the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car\nuseful.\n</p>\n<p>We have added so many new companies to Berkshire this year that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail all of the\nproducts that we will be selling at the meeting.  But come prepared to carry home everything from bricks to candy.\nOne new product, however, deserves special note:  Bob Shaw has designed a 3 x 5 rug featuring an excellent\nlikeness of Charlie.  Obviously, it would be embarrassing for Charlie \xef\xa3\xa7 make that humiliating \xef\xa3\xa7 if slow sales\nforced us to slash the rug\xe2\x80\x99s price, so step up and do your part.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them\nready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special\nshareholder\xe2\x80\x99s discount (usually 8%).  Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can\nsave you some money.\n</p>\n<p>At the Omaha airport on Saturday, we will have the usual array of aircraft from Executive Jet available for\nyour inspection.  Just ask an EJA representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what we\nconsider an appropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take them\nhome.\n</p>\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 75-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a discount that is\ncustomarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM four years ago and sales during the\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeekend\xe2\x80\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $9.1 million in 2000.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>21\n</p>\n<p>To get the discount, you must make your purchases between Wednesday, April 25 and Monday, April 30\nand also present your meeting credential.  The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several\nprestige manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that, in the spirit of our shareholder\nweekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.  NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.\non weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.\n</p>\n<p>Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xa3\xa7 the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s Manhattan store \xef\xa3\xa7 will have\ntwo shareholder-only events.  The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 27.  The\nsecond, the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, April 29.  Shareholder prices will be available\nThursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and\nSunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\nBorsheim\xe2\x80\x99s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the\nmore you buy, the more you save (or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what my family always tells me).\n</p>\n<p>In the mall outside of Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s, we will have local bridge experts available to play with our shareholders\non Sunday.  Bob Hamman, who normally is with us, will be in Africa this year.  He has promised, however, to be on\nhand in 2002.  Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will also be in the mall, taking on all comers \xef\xa3\xa7\nblindfolded!  Last year, Patrick played as many as six games simultaneously \xef\xa3\xa7 with his blindfold securely in place\n\xef\xa3\xa7 and demolished his opponents.\n</p>\n<p>As if all this isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to test your skills, our Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s Olympiad this year will also include Bill\nRobertie, one of only two players to twice win the backgammon world championship.  Backgammon can be a big\nmoney game, so bring along your stock certificates.\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xa3\xa7 my favorite steakhouse \xef\xa3\xa7 will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday,\nApril 29, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please remember that you can\xe2\x80\x99t come to Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on Sunday\nwithout a reservation.  To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 2 (but not before).  If Sunday is sold out, try\nGorat\xe2\x80\x99s on one of the other evenings you will be in town.  If you order a rare T-bone with a double order of hash\nbrowns, you will establish your credentials as an epicure.\n</p>\n<p>The usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the\nOmaha Golden Spikes will play the New Orleans Zephyrs.  Ernie Banks is again going to be on hand to \xef\xa3\xa7 bravely\n\xef\xa3\xa7 face my fastball (once clocked at 95 mpm \xef\xa3\xa7 miles per month).\n</p>\n<p>My performance last year was not my best:  It took me five pitches to throw anything resembling a strike.\nAnd, believe me, it gets lonely on the mound when you can\xe2\x80\x99t find the plate.  Finally, I got one over, and Ernie\nlashed a line drive to left field.  After I was yanked from the game, the many sports writers present asked what I had\nserved up to Ernie.  I quoted what Warren Spahn said after Willie Mays hit one of his pitches for a home run\n(Willie\xe2\x80\x99s first in the majors):  \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a helluva pitch for the first sixty feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>It will be a different story this year.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tip my hand, so let\xe2\x80\x99s just say Ernie will have to deal\nwith a pitch he has never seen before.\n</p>\n<p>Our proxy statement contains instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of\nother information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.  There will be plenty of action in town.  So come\nfor Woodstock Weekend and join our Celebration of Capitalism at the Civic.\n</p>\n<p>Warren E. Buffett\nFebruary 28, 2001 Chairman of the Board</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>'}
