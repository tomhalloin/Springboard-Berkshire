The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.\n</p>\n<p>3\n</p>\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n</p>\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n</p>\n<p>Our gain in net worth during 1998 was $25.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class\nA and Class B stock by 48.3%.  Over the last 34 years (that is, since present management took over) per-share book value\nhas grown from $19 to $37,801, a rate of 24.7% compounded annually.*\n</p>\n<p>Normally, a gain of 48.3% would call for handsprings \xe2\x80\x94 but not this year.  Remember Wagner, whose music\nhas been described as better than it sounds?  Well, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s progress in 1998 \xe2\x80\x94 though more than satisfactory \xe2\x80\x94 was not\nas good as it looks.  That\xe2\x80\x99s because most of that 48.3% gain came from our issuing shares in acquisitions.\n</p>\n<p>To explain: Our stock sells at a large premium over book value, which means that any issuing of shares we do\n\xe2\x80\x94 whether for cash or as consideration in a merger \xe2\x80\x94 instantly increases our per-share book-value figure, even though\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve earned not a dime.  What happens is that we get more per-share book value in such transactions than we give up.\nThese transactions, however, do not deliver us any immediate gain in per-share intrinsic value, because in this respect\nwhat we give and what we get are roughly equal.  And, as Charlie Munger, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Chairman and my partner,\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you too often (though you may feel that we try), it\xe2\x80\x99s the per-share gain in intrinsic value that counts rather\nthan the per-share gain in book value.  Though Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value grew very substantially in 1998, the gain fell\nwell short of the 48.3% recorded for book value.  Nevertheless, intrinsic value still far exceeds book value.  (For a more\nextensive discussion of these terms, and other investment and accounting concepts, please refer to our Owner\xe2\x80\x99s Manual,\non pages 56-64, in which we set forth our owner-related business principles.  Intrinsic value is discussed on pages 61 and\n62.)\n</p>\n<p>We entered 1999 with the best collection of businesses and managers in our history.  The two companies we\nacquired in 1998, General Re and Executive Jet, are first-class in every way \xe2\x80\x94 more about both later \xe2\x80\x94 and the\nperformance of our operating businesses last year exceeded my hopes.  GEICO, once again, simply shot the lights out.\nOn the minus side, several of the public companies in which we have major investments experienced significant operating\nshortfalls that neither they nor I  anticipated early in the year.  Consequently, our equity portfolio did not perform nearly\nas well as did the S&amp;P 500.  The problems of these companies are almost certainly temporary, and Charlie and I believe\nthat their long-term prospects are excellent.\n</p>\n<p>In our last three annual reports, we furnished you a table that we regard as central to estimating Berkshire\'s\nintrinsic value.  In the updated version of that table, which follows, we trace our two key components of value, including\nGeneral Re on a pro-forma basis as if we had owned it throughout the year.  The first column lists our per-share\nownership of investments (including cash and equivalents but excluding securities held in our financial products\noperation) and the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire\'s operating businesses before taxes and\npurchase-accounting adjustments (discussed on pages 62 and 63), but after all interest and corporate expenses.  The\nsecond column excludes all dividends, interest and capital gains that we realized from the investments presented in the\nfirst column.  In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would look if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding\nour investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing all corporate costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>4\n</p>\n<p>Pre-tax Earnings Per Share\nInvestments With All Income from\n</p>\n<p>Year Per Share Investments Excluded\n</p>\n<p>1968 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $     53 $  2.87\n1978 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       465   12.85\n1988 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    4,876 145.77\n1998 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       47,647                    474.45\n</p>\n<p>Here are the growth rates of the two segments by decade:\nPre-tax Earnings Per Share\n</p>\n<p>Investments With All Income from\nDecade Ending Per Share Investments Excluded\n</p>\n<p>1978 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.2% 16.2%\n1988 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26.5% 27.5%\n1998 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25.6% 12.5%\n</p>\n<p>Annual Growth Rate, 1968-1998 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  25.4% 18.6%\n</p>\n<p>During 1998, our investments increased by $9,604 per share, or 25.2%, but per-share operating earnings fell by\n33.9%.  General Re (included, as noted, on a pro-forma basis) explains both facts.  This company has very large\ninvestments, and these greatly increased our per-share investment figure.  But General Re also had an underwriting loss\nin 1998, and that hurt operating earnings.  Had we not acquired General Re, per-share operating earnings would have\nshown a modest gain.\n</p>\n<p>Though certain of our acquisitions and operating strategies may from time to time affect one column more than the\nother, we continually work to increase the figures in both.  But one thing is certain: Our future rates of gain will fall far\nshort of those achieved in the past.  Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s capital base is now simply too large to allow us to earn truly outsized\nreturns.  If you believe otherwise, you should consider a career in sales but avoid one in mathematics (bearing in mind\nthat there are really only three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can\xe2\x80\x99t).\n</p>\n<p>Currently we are working to compound a net worth of $57.4 billion, the largest of any American corporation\n(though our figure will be eclipsed if the merger of Exxon and Mobil takes place).  Of course, our lead in net worth  does\nnot mean that Berkshire outranks all other businesses in value: Market value is what counts for owners and General\nElectric and Microsoft, for example, have valuations more than three times Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s.  Net worth, though,  measures\nthe capital that managers must deploy, and at Berkshire that figure has indeed become huge.\n</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Charlie and I will do our best to increase intrinsic value in the future at an average rate of 15%, a\nresult we consider to be at the very peak of possible outcomes.  We may have years when we exceed 15%, but we will\nmost certainly have other years when we fall far short of that \xe2\x80\x94 including years showing negative returns \xe2\x80\x94 and those\nwill bring our average down.  In the meantime, you should understand just what an average gain of 15% over the next\nfive years implies: It means we will need to increase net worth by $58 billion.  Earning this daunting 15% will require\nus to come up with big ideas: Popcorn stands just won\xe2\x80\x99t do.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s markets are not friendly to our search for\n\xe2\x80\x9celephants,\xe2\x80\x9d but you can be sure that we will stay  focused on the hunt.\n</p>\n<p>Whatever the future holds, I make you one promise: I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep at least 99% of my net worth in Berkshire for as long\nas I am around.  How long will that be?  My model is the loyal Democrat in Fort Wayne who asked to be buried in\nChicago so that he could stay active in the party.  To that end, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already selected a \xe2\x80\x9cpower spot\xe2\x80\x9d at the office for my\nurn.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Our financial growth has been matched by employment growth: We now have 47,566 on our payroll, with the\nacquisitions of 1998 bringing 7,074 employees to us and internal growth adding another 2,500.  To balance this gain </p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>5\n</p>\n<p>of 9,500 in hands-on employees, we have enlarged the staff at world headquarters from 12 to 12.8.  (The .8 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t refer\nto me or Charlie:  We have a new person in accounting, working four days a week.)  Despite this alarming trend toward\ncorporate bloat, our after-tax overhead last year was about $3.5 million, or well under  one basis point (.01 of 1%) of the\nvalue of the assets we manage.\n</p>\n<p>Taxes\n</p>\n<p>One beneficiary of our increased size has been the U.S. Treasury.  The federal income taxes that Berkshire and\nGeneral Re have paid, or will soon pay, in respect to 1998 earnings total $2.7 billion.  That means we shouldered all of\nthe U.S. Government\xe2\x80\x99s expenses for more than a half-day.\n</p>\n<p>Follow that thought a little further: If only 625 other U.S. taxpayers had paid the Treasury as much as we and\nGeneral Re did last year, no one else \xe2\x80\x94 neither corporations nor 270 million citizens \xe2\x80\x94 would have had to pay federal\nincome taxes or any other kind of federal tax (for example, social security or estate taxes).  Our shareholders can truly\nsay that they \xe2\x80\x9cgave at the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Writing checks to the IRS that include strings of zeros does not bother Charlie or me.  Berkshire as a corporation,\nand we as individuals, have prospered in America as we would have in no other country.  Indeed, if we lived in some\nother part of the world and completely escaped taxes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we would be worse off financially (and in many other ways\nas well).  Overall, we feel extraordinarily lucky to have been dealt a hand in life that enables us to write large checks to\nthe government rather than one requiring the government to regularly write checks to us \xe2\x80\x94 say, because we are disabled\nor unemployed.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s tax situation is sometimes misunderstood.  First, capital gains have no special attraction for us: A\ncorporation pays a 35% rate on taxable income, whether it comes from capital gains or from ordinary operations.  This\nmeans that Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s tax on a long-term capital gain is fully 75% higher than what an individual would pay on an\nidentical gain.\n</p>\n<p>Some people harbor another misconception, believing that we can exclude 70% of all dividends we receive from\nour taxable income.  Indeed, the 70% rate applies to most corporations and also applies to Berkshire in cases where we\nhold stocks in non-insurance subsidiaries.  However, almost all of our equity investments are owned by  our insurance\ncompanies, and in that case the exclusion is 59.5%.  That still means a dollar of dividends is considerably more valuable\nto us than a dollar of ordinary income, but not to the degree often assumed.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire truly went all out for the Treasury last year.  In connection with the General Re merger, we wrote a $30\nmillion check to the government to pay an SEC fee tied to the new shares created by the deal.  We understand that this\npayment set an SEC record.  Charlie and I are enormous admirers of what the Commission has accomplished for\nAmerican investors.  We would rather, however, have found another way to show our admiration.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO (1-800-847-7536)\n</p>\n<p>Combine a great idea with a great manager and you\xe2\x80\x99re certain to obtain a great result.  That mix is alive and well\nat GEICO.  The idea is low-cost auto insurance, made possible by direct-to-customer marketing, and the manager is Tony\nNicely.  Quite simply, there is no one in the business world who could run GEICO better than Tony does.  His instincts\nare unerring, his energy is boundless, and his execution is flawless.  While maintaining underwriting discipline, Tony\nis building an organization that is gaining market share at an accelerating rate.\n</p>\n<p>This pace has been encouraged by our compensation policies.  The direct writing of insurance \xe2\x80\x94 that is, without\nthere being an agent or broker between the insurer and its policyholder \xe2\x80\x94 involves a substantial front-end investment.\nFirst-year business is therefore unprofitable in a major way.  At GEICO, we do not wish this cost to deter our associates\nfrom the aggressive pursuit of new business \xe2\x80\x94 which, as it renews, will deliver significant profits  \xe2\x80\x94 so we leave it out\nof our compensation formulas.  What\xe2\x80\x99s included then?  We base 50% of our associates\xe2\x80\x99 bonuses and profit sharing on</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>6\n</p>\n<p>the earnings of our \xe2\x80\x9cseasoned\xe2\x80\x9d book, meaning policies that have been with us for more than a year.  The other 50% is\ntied to growth in policyholders \xe2\x80\x94 and here we have stepped on the gas.\n</p>\n<p>In 1995, the year prior to its acquisition by Berkshire, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 652\ntelephone counselors.  Last year the company spent $143 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,162.  The effects\nthat these efforts had at the company are shown by the new business and in-force figures below:\n</p>\n<p>New Auto Auto Policies\nYears       Policies*         In-Force*\n</p>\n<p>1993 1,354,882 2,011,055\n1994 1,396,217 2,147,549\n1995 1,461,608 2,310,037\n1996 1,617,669 2,543,699\n1997 1,913,176 2,949,439\n1998 1,317,761 3,562,644\n</p>\n<p>* \xe2\x80\x9cVoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d only; excludes assigned risks and the like.\n</p>\n<p>In 1999, we will again increase our marketing budget, spending at least $190 million.  In fact, there is no limit to\nwhat Berkshire is willing to invest in GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s new-business activity, as long as we can concurrently build the\ninfrastructure the company needs to properly serve its policyholders.\n</p>\n<p>Because of the first-year costs, companies that are concerned about quarterly or annual earnings would shy from\nsimilar investments, no matter how intelligent these might be in terms of building long-term value.  Our calculus is\ndifferent: We simply measure whether we are creating more than a dollar of value per dollar spent \xe2\x80\x94 and if that\ncalculation is favorable, the more dollars we spend the happier I am.\n</p>\n<p>There is far more to GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s success, of course, than low prices and a torrent of advertising.  The handling of\nclaims must also be fair, fast and friendly \xe2\x80\x94 and ours is.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s an impartial scorecard on how we shape up: In New\nYork, our largest-volume state, the Insurance Department recently reported that GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s complaint ratio in 1997 was\nnot only the lowest of the five largest auto insurers but was also less than half the average of the other four.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s 1998 profit margin of 6.7% was better than we had anticipated \xe2\x80\x94 and, indeed, better than we wished.\nOur results reflect an industry-wide phenomenon: In recent years, both the frequency of auto accidents and their severity\nhave unexpectedly declined.  We responded by reducing rates 3.3% in 1998, and we will reduce them still more in 1999.\nThese moves will soon bring profit margins down \xe2\x80\x94 at the least to 4%, which is our target, and perhaps considerably\nlower.  Whatever the case, we believe that our margins will continue to be much better than those of the industry.\n</p>\n<p>With GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s growth and profitability both outstanding in 1998, so also were its profit-sharing and bonus\npayments.  Indeed, the profit-sharing payment of $103 million or 32.3% of salary \xe2\x80\x94 which went to all 9,313 associates\nwho had been with us for more than a year \xe2\x80\x94 may well have been the highest percentage payment at any large company\nin the country.  (In addition, associates benefit from a company-funded pension plan.)\n</p>\n<p>The 32.3% may turn out to be a high-water mark, given that the profitability component in our profit-sharing\ncalculation is almost certain to come down in the future.  The growth component, though,  may well increase.  Overall,\nwe expect the two benchmarks together to dictate very significant profit-sharing payments for decades to come.  For our\nassociates, growth pays off in other ways as well: Last year we promoted 4,612 people.\n</p>\n<p>Impressive as the GEICO figures are, we have far more to do.  Our market share improved significantly in 1998\n\xe2\x80\x94 but only from 3% to 3\xc2\xbd%.  For every policyholder we now have, there are another ten who should be giving us their\nbusiness.\n</p>\n<p>Some of you who are reading this may be in that category.  About 40% of those who check our rates find that they\ncan save money by doing business with us.  The proportion is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting\njudgements, with some giving more credit than we do to drivers who live in certain geographical areas or work at certain\noccupations.  We believe, however, that we more frequently offer the low price than does any other national carrier</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>7\n</p>\n<p>selling insurance to all comers.  Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer a special discount \xe2\x80\x94 usually 8% \xe2\x80\x94 to our\nshareholders.  So give us a call and check us out.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>You may think that one commercial in this section is enough.  But I have another to present, this one directed at\nmanagers of publicly-owned companies.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire we feel that telling outstanding CEOs, such as Tony, how to run their companies would be the height\nof foolishness.  Most of our managers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work for us if they got a lot of backseat driving.   (Generally, they don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave to work for anyone, since 75% or so are independently wealthy.)  Besides, they are the Mark McGwires of the\nbusiness world and need no advice from us as to how to hold the bat or when to swing.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s ownership may make even the best of managers more effective.  First, we eliminate all\nof the ritualistic and nonproductive activities that normally go with the job of CEO.  Our managers are totally in charge\nof their personal schedules.  Second, we give each a simple mission: Just run your business as if: 1) you own 100% of\nit; 2) it is the only asset in the world that you and your family have or will ever have; and 3) you can\xe2\x80\x99t sell or merge it\nfor at least a century.  As a corollary, we tell them they should not let any of their decisions be affected even slightly by\naccounting considerations.  We want our managers to think about what counts, not how it will be counted.\n</p>\n<p>Very few CEOs of public companies operate under a similar mandate, mainly because they have owners who focus\non short-term prospects and reported earnings.  Berkshire, however, has a shareholder base \xe2\x80\x94 which it will have for\ndecades to come \xe2\x80\x94 that has the longest investment horizon to be found in the public-company universe.  Indeed, a\nmajority of our shares are held by investors who expect to die still holding them.  We can therefore ask our CEOs to\nmanage for maximum long-term value, rather than for next quarter\xe2\x80\x99s earnings.  We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t ignore the current\nresults of our businesses \xe2\x80\x94 in most cases, they are of great importance \xe2\x80\x94 but we never want them to be achieved at the\nexpense of our building ever-greater competitive strengths.\n</p>\n<p>I believe the GEICO story demonstrates the benefits of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  Charlie and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t taught Tony\na thing \xe2\x80\x94 and never will \xe2\x80\x94  but we have created an environment that allows him to apply all of his talents to what\xe2\x80\x99s\nimportant.  He does not have to devote his time or energy to board meetings, press interviews, presentations by investment\nbankers or talks with financial analysts.  Furthermore, he need never spend a moment thinking about financing, credit\nratings or \xe2\x80\x9cStreet\xe2\x80\x9d expectations for earnings per share.  Because of our ownership structure, he also knows that this\noperational framework will endure for decades to come.  In this environment of freedom, both Tony and his company\ncan convert their almost limitless potential into matching achievements.\n</p>\n<p>If you are running a large, profitable business that will thrive in a GEICO-like environment, check our acquisition\ncriteria on page 21 and give me a call.  I promise a fast answer and will mention your inquiry to no one except\nCharlie.\n</p>\n<p>Executive Jet Aviation (1-800-848-6436)\n</p>\n<p>To understand the huge potential at Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), you need some understanding of its business,\nwhich is selling fractional shares of jets and operating the fleet for its many owners.  Rich Santulli, CEO of EJA, created\nthe fractional ownership industry in 1986, by visualizing an important new way of using planes.  Then he combined guts\nand talent to turn his idea into a major business.\n</p>\n<p>In a fractional ownership plan, you purchase a portion \xe2\x80\x94 say /8th \xe2\x80\x94 of any of a wide variety of jets that EJA1\n</p>\n<p>offers.  That purchase entitles you to 100 hours of flying time annually.  (\xe2\x80\x9cDead-head\xe2\x80\x9d hours don\xe2\x80\x99t count against your\nallotment, and you are also allowed to average your hours over five years.)  In addition, you pay both a monthly\nmanagement fee and a fee for hours actually flown.\n</p>\n<p>Then, on a few hours notice, EJA makes your plane, or another at least as good, available to you at your choice of\nthe 5500 airports in the U.S.  In effect, calling up your plane is like phoning for a taxi. </p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>8\n</p>\n<p>I first heard about the NetJets\xc2\xae program, as it is called, about four years ago from Frank Rooney, our manager at\nH.H. Brown.  Frank had used and been delighted with the service and suggested that I meet Rich to investigate signing\nup for my family\xe2\x80\x99s use.  It took Rich about 15 minutes to sell me a quarter (200 hours annually) of a Hawker 1000.  Since\nthen, my family has learned firsthand \xe2\x80\x94 through flying 900 hours on 300 trips \xe2\x80\x94 what a friendly, efficient, and safe\noperation EJA runs.  Quite simply, they love this service.  In fact, they quickly grew so enthusiastic  that I did a\ntestimonial ad for EJA long before I knew there was any possibility of our purchasing the business.  I did, however, ask\nRich to give me a call if he ever got interested in selling.  Luckily, he phoned me last May, and we quickly made a $725\nmillion deal, paying equal amounts of cash and stock.\n</p>\n<p>EJA, which is by far the largest operator in its industry, has more than 1,000 customers and 163 aircraft (including\n23 \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d aircraft that are owned or leased by EJA itself, so that it can make sure that service is first-class even during\nthe times when demand is heaviest).  Safety, of course, is the paramount issue in any flight operation, and Rich\xe2\x80\x99s pilots\n\xe2\x80\x94 now numbering about 650 \xe2\x80\x94 receive extensive training at least twice a year from FlightSafety International, another\nBerkshire subsidiary and the world leader in pilot training.  The bottom line on our pilots: I\xe2\x80\x99ve sold the Berkshire plane\nand will now do all of my business flying, as well as my personal flying, with NetJets\xe2\x80\x99 crews.\n</p>\n<p>Being the leader in this industry is a major advantage for all concerned.  Our customers gain because we have an\narmada of planes positioned throughout the country at all times, a blanketing that allows us to provide unmatched service.\nMeanwhile, we gain from the blanketing because it reduces dead-head costs.  Another compelling attraction for our\nclients is that we offer products from Boeing, Gulfstream, Falcon, Cessna, and Raytheon, whereas our two competitors\nare owned by manufacturers that offer only their own planes.  In effect, NetJets is like a physician who can recommend\nwhatever medicine best fits the needs of each patient; our competitors, in contrast, are producers of  a \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d brand that\nthey must prescribe for one and all.\n</p>\n<p>In many cases our clients, both corporate and individual, own fractions of several different planes and can therefore\nmatch specific planes to specific missions.  For example, a client might own /16th of three different jets (each giving it1\n</p>\n<p>50 hours of flying time), which in total give it a virtual fleet, obtained for a small fraction of the cost of a single plane.\n</p>\n<p>Significantly, it is not only small businesses that can benefit from fractional ownership.  Already, some of America\xe2\x80\x99s\nlargest companies use NetJets as a supplement to their own fleet.  This saves them big money in both meeting peak\nrequirements and in flying missions that would require their wholly-owned planes to log a disproportionate amount of\ndead-head hours.\n</p>\n<p>When a plane is slated for personal use, the clinching argument is that either the client signs up now or his children\nlikely will later.  That\xe2\x80\x99s an equation I explained to my wonderful Aunt Alice 40 years ago when she asked me whether\nshe could afford a fur coat.

If many thousands\nof owners find it sensible to own 100% of a plane \xe2\x80\x94 which must be used 350-400 hours annually if it\xe2\x80\x99s  to make\neconomic sense \xe2\x80\x94 there must be a large multiple of that number for whom fractional ownership works.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to being a terrific executive, Rich is fun.  Like most of our managers, he has no economic need\nwhatsoever to work.  Rich spends his time at EJA because it\xe2\x80\x99s his baby \xe2\x80\x94 and he wants to see how far he can take it.\nWe both already know the answer, both literally and figuratively: to the ends of the earth.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>And now a small hint to Berkshire directors: Last year I spent more than nine times my salary at Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s and\nEJA.

In addition to owning 100% of\nGeneral Reinsurance Corporation, the largest U.S. property-casualty reinsurer, the company also owns (including stock\nit has an arrangement to buy) 82% of the oldest reinsurance company in the world, Cologne Re.  The two companies\ntogether reinsure all lines of insurance and operate in 124 countries.\n</p>\n<p>For many decades, General Re\xe2\x80\x99s name has stood for quality, integrity and professionalism in reinsurance \xe2\x80\x94 and\nunder Ron Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, this reputation has been burnished still more.  Berkshire can add absolutely nothing\nto the skills of General Re\xe2\x80\x99s and Cologne Re\xe2\x80\x99s managers.  On the contrary, there is a lot that they can teach us.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we believe that Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s ownership will benefit General Re in important ways and that its earnings\na decade from now will materially exceed those that would have been attainable absent the merger.  We base this\noptimism on the fact that we can offer General Re\xe2\x80\x99s management a freedom to operate in whatever manner will best allow\nthe company to exploit its strengths.\n</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s look for a moment at the reinsurance business to understand why General Re could not on its own do what\nit can under Berkshire.  Most of the demand for reinsurance comes from primary insurers who want to escape  the wide\nswings in earnings that result from large and unusual losses.  In effect, a reinsurer gets paid for absorbing the  volatility\nthat the client insurer wants to shed.\n</p>\n<p>Ironically, though, a publicly-held reinsurer gets graded by both its owners and those who evaluate its credit on the\nsmoothness of its own results.  Wide swings in earnings hurt both credit ratings and p/e ratios, even when the business\nthat produces such swings has an expectancy of satisfactory profits over time.  This market reality sometimes causes a\nreinsurer to make costly moves, among them laying off a significant portion of the business it writes (in transactions that\nare called \xe2\x80\x9cretrocessions\xe2\x80\x9d) or rejecting good business simply because it threatens to bring on too much volatility.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire, in contrast, happily accepts volatility, just as long as it carries with it the expectation of increased  profits\nover time.  Furthermore, we are a Fort Knox of capital, and that means volatile earnings can\xe2\x80\x99t impair our premier credit\nratings.  Thus we have the perfect structure for writing \xe2\x80\x94 and retaining \xe2\x80\x94 reinsurance in virtually any amount.  In fact,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve used this strength over the past decade to build a powerful super-cat business.\n</p>\n<p>What General Re gives us, however, is the distribution force, technical facilities and management that will allow\nus to employ our structural strength in every facet of the industry.  In particular, General Re and Cologne Re can now\naccelerate their push into international markets, where the preponderance of industry growth will almost certainly occur.\nAs the merger proxy statement spelled out, Berkshire also brings tax and investment benefits to General Re.  But the most\ncompelling reason for the merger is simply that General Re\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding management can now do what it does best,\nunfettered by the constraints that have limited its growth.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire is assuming responsibility for General Re\xe2\x80\x99s investment portfolio, though not for Cologne Re\xe2\x80\x99s.  We will\nnot, however, be involved in General Re\xe2\x80\x99s underwriting.  We will simply ask the company to exercise the discipline of\nthe past while increasing the proportion of its business that is retained, expanding its product line, and widening its\ngeographical coverage \xe2\x80\x94 making these moves in recognition of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s financial strength and tolerance for wide\nswings in earnings.  As we\xe2\x80\x99ve long said, we prefer a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%.\n</p>\n<p>Over time, Ron and his team will maximize General Re\xe2\x80\x99s new potential.  He and I have known each other for\nmany years, and each of our companies has initiated significant business that it has reinsured with the other.  Indeed,\nGeneral Re played a key role in the resuscitation of GEICO from its near-death status in 1976.\n</p>\n<p>Both Ron and Rich Santulli plan to be at the annual meeting, and I hope you get a chance to say hello to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>10\n</p>\n<p>The Economics of Property-Casualty Insurance\n</p>\n<p>With the acquisition of General Re \xe2\x80\x94 and with GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s business mushrooming \xe2\x80\x94 it becomes more important than ever\nthat you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key determinants are: (1) the amount of float that the\nbusiness generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most important of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.\n</p>\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are\nreceived before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that time, the insurer invests\nthe money.  Typically, this pleasant activity carries with it a downside:  The premiums that an insurer takes in usually\ndo not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which is the\ncost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would\notherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.\n</p>\n<p>A caution is appropriate here:  Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring\ntheir underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company\'s true cost of float.  Errors\nof estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge.  The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly\ninto earnings.  An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can\ntypically do no more than accept what\'s presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name\nauditors have implicitly blessed.  As for Berkshire, Charlie and I attempt to be conservative in presenting its underwriting\nresults to you, because we have found that virtually all surprises in insurance are unpleasant ones.\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows the float generated by Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s insurance operations since we entered the business\n32 years ago.  The data are for every fifth year and also the last, which includes General Re\xe2\x80\x99s huge float.  For the table\nwe have calculated our float \xe2\x80\x94 which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \xe2\x80\x94 by adding net\nloss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then\nsubtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed\nreinsurance.  (Got that?)\n</p>\n<p>Year Average Float\n(in $ millions)\n</p>\n<p>1967    17\n1972    70\n1977   139\n1982   221\n1987 1,267\n1992 2,290\n1997 7,093\n</p>\n<p>1998              22,762 (yearend)\n</p>\n<p>Impressive as the growth in our float has been \xe2\x80\x94 25.4% compounded annually \xe2\x80\x94 what really counts is the cost\nof this item.  If that becomes too high, growth in float becomes a curse rather than a blessing.  \n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, the news is all good: Our average cost over the 32 years has been well under zero.  In aggregate, we\nhave posted a substantial underwriting profit, which means that we have been paid for holding a large and growing\namount of money.  This is the best of all worlds.  Indeed, though our net float is recorded on our balance sheet as a\nliability, it has had more economic value to us than an equal amount of net worth would have had.  As long as we can\ncontinue to achieve an underwriting profit, float will continue to outrank net worth in value.\n</p>\n<p>During the next few years, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s growth in float may well be modest.  The reinsurance market is soft, and\nin this business, relationships change slowly.  Therefore, General Re\xe2\x80\x99s float \xe2\x80\x94 /3rds of our total \xe2\x80\x94 is unlikely to2\n</p>\n<p>increase significantly in the near term.  We do expect, however, that our cost of float will remain very attractive compared\nto that of other insurers.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>11\n</p>\n<p>Sources of Reported Earnings\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire\'s reported earnings.

Many of these joined us when we purchased their companies, but in recent years we have also identified a\nnumber of strong managers internally.

And, even then, we are not\nall that energetic.  We have one excuse, though: In allocating capital, activity does not correlate with achievement.\nIndeed, in the fields of investments and acquisitions, frenetic behavior is often counterproductive.

Naturally, they want to be paid fairly for their efforts,\nbut pay alone can\xe2\x80\x99t explain their extraordinary accomplishments.

However, we trimmed or substantially cut many of our smaller\npositions.  Here, I need to make a confession (ugh):  The portfolio actions I took in 1998 actually decreased our\ngain for the year.  In particular, my decision to sell McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s was a very big mistake.  Overall, you would have\nbeen better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the movies during market hours.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>13\n</p>\n<p>At yearend, we held more than $15 billion in cash equivalents (including high-grade securities due in less\nthan one year).  Cash never makes us happy.  But it\xe2\x80\x99s better to have the money burning a hole in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\npocket than resting comfortably in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s.  Charlie and I will continue our search for large equity\ninvestments or, better yet, a really major business acquisition that would absorb our liquid assets.  Currently,\nhowever, we see nothing on the horizon.\n</p>\n<p>Once we knew that the General Re merger would definitely take place, we asked the company to dispose of\nthe equities that it held.  (As mentioned earlier, we do not manage the Cologne Re portfolio, which includes many\nequities.)  General Re subsequently eliminated its positions in about 250 common stocks, incurring $935 million\nof taxes in the process.  This \xe2\x80\x9cclean sweep\xe2\x80\x9d approach reflects a basic principle that Charlie and I employ in\nbusiness and investing: We don\xe2\x80\x99t back into decisions.\n</p>\n<p>Last year I deviated from my standard practice of not disclosing our investments (other than those we are\nlegally required to report) and told you about three unconventional investments we had made.  There were several\nreasons behind that disclosure.  First, questions about our silver position that we had received from regulatory\nauthorities led us to believe that they wished us to publicly acknowledge this investment.  Second, our holdings\nof zero-coupon bonds were so large that we wanted our owners to know of this investment\xe2\x80\x99s potential impact on\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s net worth.  Third, we simply wanted to alert you to the fact that we sometimes do make unconventional\ncommitments.\n</p>\n<p>Normally, however, as discussed in the Owner\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on page 61, we see no advantage in talking about\nspecific investment actions.  Therefore \xe2\x80\x94 unless we again take a position that is particularly large \xe2\x80\x94 we will not\npost you as to what we are doing in respect to any specific holding of an unconventional sort.  We can report,\nhowever, that we have eliminated certain of the positions discussed last year and added certain others.\n</p>\n<p>Our never-comment-even-if-untrue policy in regard to investments may disappoint \xe2\x80\x9cpiggybackers\xe2\x80\x9d but will\nbenefit owners: Your Berkshire shares would be worth less if we discussed what we are doing.  Incidentally, we\nshould warn you that media speculation about our investment moves continues in most cases to be incorrect.\nPeople who rely on such commentary do so at their own peril.\n</p>\n<p>Accounting \xe2\x80\x94 Part 1\n</p>\n<p>Our General Re acquisition put a spotlight on an egregious flaw in accounting procedure.  Sharp-eyed\nshareholders reading our proxy statement probably noticed an unusual item on page 60.  In the pro-forma\nstatement of income \xe2\x80\x94 which detailed how the combined 1997 earnings of the two entities would have been\naffected by the merger \xe2\x80\x94 there was an item stating that compensation expense would have been increased by $63\nmillion.\n</p>\n<p>This item, we hasten to add, does not signal that either Charlie or I have experienced a major personality\nchange.  (He still travels coach and quotes Ben Franklin.)  Nor does it indicate any shortcoming in General Re\xe2\x80\x99s\naccounting practices, which have followed GAAP to the letter.  Instead, the pro-forma adjustment came about\nbecause we are replacing General Re\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding stock option plan with a cash plan that ties the incentive\ncompensation of General Re managers to their operating achievements.  Formerly what counted for these managers\nwas General Re\xe2\x80\x99s stock price; now their payoff will come from the business performance they deliver.\n</p>\n<p>The new plan and the terminated option arrangement have matching economics, which means that the rewards\nthey deliver to employees should, for a given level of performance, be the same.  But what these people could have\nformerly anticipated earning from new option grants will now be paid in cash.  (Options granted in past years\nremain outstanding.)\n</p>\n<p>Though the two plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different\naccounting result.  This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost\nof stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a\ngreat many corporations.  In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form\nand count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost.  Small wonder then that the use of options</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '12': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>14\n</p>\n<p>has mushroomed.  This lop-sided choice has a big downside for owners, however: Though options, if properly\nstructured, can be an appropriate, and even ideal, way to compensate and motivate top managers, they are more\noften wildly capricious in their distribution of rewards, inefficient as motivators, and inordinately expensive for\nshareholders.\n</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of options may be, their accounting treatment is outrageous.  Think for a moment of that\n$190 million we are going to spend for advertising at GEICO this year.  Suppose that instead of paying cash for\nour ads, we paid the media in ten-year, at-the-market Berkshire options.  Would anyone then care to argue\nthat Berkshire had not borne a cost for advertising, or should not be charged this cost on its books?\n</p>\n<p>Perhaps Bishop Berkeley \xe2\x80\x94 you may remember him as the philosopher who mused about trees falling in a\nforest when no one was around \xe2\x80\x94 would believe that an expense unseen by an accountant does not exist.  Charlie\nand I, however, have trouble being philosophical about unrecorded costs.  When we consider investing in an option-\nissuing company, we make an appropriate downward adjustment to reported earnings, simply subtracting an amount\nequal to what the company could have realized by publicly selling options of like quantity and structure.  Similarly,\nif we contemplate an acquisition, we include in our evaluation the cost of replacing any option plan.  Then, if we\nmake a deal, we promptly take that cost out of hiding.\n</p>\n<p>Readers who disagree with me about options will by this time be mentally quarreling with my equating the\ncost of options issued to employees with those that might theoretically be sold and traded publicly.  It is true, to\nstate one of these arguments, that employee options are sometimes forfeited \xe2\x80\x94 that lessens the damage done to\nshareholders \xe2\x80\x94 whereas publicly-offered options would not be.  It is true, also, that companies receive a tax\ndeduction when employee options are exercised; publicly-traded options deliver no such benefit.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s an\noffset to these points: Options issued to employees are often repriced, a transformation that makes them much more\ncostly than the public variety.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes argued that a non-transferable option given to an employee is less valuable to him than would\nbe a publicly-traded option that he could freely sell.  That fact, however, does not reduce the cost of the non-\ntransferable option: Giving an employee a company car that can only be used for certain purposes diminishes its\nvalue to the employee, but does not in the least diminish its cost to the employer. \n</p>\n<p>The earning revisions that Charlie and I have made for options in recent years have frequently cut the\nreported per-share figures by 5%, with 10% not all that uncommon.  On occasion, the downward adjustment has\nbeen so great that it has affected our portfolio decisions, causing us either to make a sale or to pass on a stock\npurchase we might otherwise have made. \n</p>\n<p>A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: \xe2\x80\x9cIf\noptions aren\xe2\x80\x99t a form of compensation, what are they?  If compensation isn\xe2\x80\x99t an expense, what is it?  And, if\nexpenses shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Accounting \xe2\x80\x94 Part 2\n</p>\n<p>The role that managements have played in stock-option accounting has hardly been benign: A distressing\nnumber of both CEOs and auditors have in recent years bitterly fought FASB\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to replace option fiction\nwith truth and virtually none have spoken out in support of FASB.  Its opponents even enlisted Congress in the\nfight, pushing the case that inflated figures were in the national interest.\n</p>\n<p>Still, I believe that the behavior of managements has been even worse when it comes to restructurings and\nmerger accounting.  Here, many managements purposefully work at manipulating numbers and deceiving investors.\nAnd, as Michael Kinsley has said about Washington: \xe2\x80\x9cThe scandal isn\xe2\x80\x99t in what\xe2\x80\x99s done that\xe2\x80\x99s illegal but rather\nin what\xe2\x80\x99s legal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>It was once relatively easy to tell the good guys in accounting from the bad: The late 1960\'s, for example,\nbrought on an orgy of what one charlatan dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cbold, imaginative accounting\xe2\x80\x9d (the practice of which,\nincidentally, made him loved for a time by Wall Street because he never missed expectations).  But most investors</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>15\n</p>\n<p>of that period knew who was playing games.  And, to their credit, virtually all of America\xe2\x80\x99s most-admired\ncompanies then shunned deception.\n</p>\n<p>In recent years, probity has eroded.  Many major corporations still play things straight, but a significant and\ngrowing number of otherwise high-grade managers \xe2\x80\x94 CEOs you would be happy to have as spouses for your\nchildren or as trustees under your will \xe2\x80\x94 have come to the view that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to manipulate earnings to satisfy\nwhat they believe are Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s desires.  Indeed, many CEOs think this kind of manipulation is not only okay,\nbut actually their duty.\n</p>\n<p>These managers start with the assumption, all too common, that their job at all times is to encourage the\nhighest stock price possible (a premise with which we adamantly disagree).  To pump the price, they strive,\nadmirably, for operational excellence.  But when operations don\xe2\x80\x99t produce the result hoped for, these CEOs resort\nto unadmirable accounting stratagems.  These either manufacture the desired \xe2\x80\x9cearnings\xe2\x80\x9d or set the stage for them\nin the future.\n</p>\n<p>Rationalizing this behavior, these managers often say that their shareholders will be hurt if their currency\nfor doing deals \xe2\x80\x94 that is, their stock \xe2\x80\x94 is not fully-priced, and they also argue that in using accounting\nshenanigans to get the figures they want, they are only doing what everybody else does.  Once such an\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s-doing-it attitude takes hold, ethical misgivings vanish.  Call this behavior Son of Gresham: Bad\naccounting drives out good.\n</p>\n<p>The distortion du jour is the \xe2\x80\x9crestructuring charge,\xe2\x80\x9d an accounting entry that can, of course, be legitimate\nbut that too often is a device for manipulating earnings.  In this bit of legerdemain, a large chunk of costs that\nshould properly be attributed to a number of years is dumped into a single quarter, typically one already fated to\ndisappoint investors.  In some cases, the purpose of the charge is to clean up earnings misrepresentations of the\npast, and in others it is to prepare the ground for future misrepresentations.  In either case, the size and timing\nof these charges is dictated by the cynical proposition that Wall Street will not mind if earnings fall short by $5\nper share in a given quarter, just as long as this deficiency ensures that quarterly earnings in the future will\nconsistently exceed expectations by five cents per share.\n</p>\n<p>This dump-everything-into-one-quarter behavior suggests a corresponding \xe2\x80\x9cbold, imaginative\xe2\x80\x9d approach to\n\xe2\x80\x94 golf scores.  In his first round of the season, a golfer should ignore his actual performance and simply fill his\ncard with atrocious numbers \xe2\x80\x94 double, triple, quadruple bogeys \xe2\x80\x94 and then turn in a score of, say, 140.  Having\nestablished this \xe2\x80\x9creserve,\xe2\x80\x9d he should go to the golf shop and tell his pro that he wishes to \xe2\x80\x9crestructure\xe2\x80\x9d his\nimperfect swing.  Next, as he takes his new swing onto the course, he should count his good holes, but not the\nbad ones.  These remnants from his old swing should be charged instead to the reserve established earlier.  At\nthe end of five rounds, then, his record will be 140, 80, 80, 80, 80 rather than 91, 94, 89, 94, 92.  On Wall\nStreet, they will ignore the 140 \xe2\x80\x94 which, after all, came from a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscontinued\xe2\x80\x9d swing \xe2\x80\x94 and will classify our\nhero as an 80 shooter (and one who never disappoints).\n</p>\n<p>For those who prefer to cheat up front, there would be a variant of this strategy.  The golfer, playing alone\nwith a cooperative caddy-auditor, should defer the recording of bad holes, take four 80s, accept the plaudits he\ngets for such athleticism and consistency, and then turn in a fifth card carrying a 140 score.  After rectifying his\nearlier scorekeeping sins with this \xe2\x80\x9cbig bath,\xe2\x80\x9d he may mumble a few apologies but will refrain from returning\nthe sums he has previously collected from comparing scorecards in the clubhouse.  (The caddy, need we add, will\nhave acquired a loyal patron.)\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, CEOs who use variations of these scoring schemes in real life tend to become addicted to the\ngames they\xe2\x80\x99re playing \xe2\x80\x94 after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to fiddle with the scorecard than to spend hours on the practice tee\n\xe2\x80\x94 and never muster the will to give them up.  Their behavior brings to mind Voltaire\xe2\x80\x99s comment on sexual\nexperimentation: \xe2\x80\x9cOnce a philosopher, twice a pervert.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>In the acquisition arena, restructuring has been raised to an art form: Managements now frequently use\nmergers to dishonestly rearrange the value of assets and liabilities in ways that will allow them to both smooth\nand swell future earnings.  Indeed, at deal time, major auditing firms sometimes point out the possibilities for a\nlittle accounting magic (or for a lot).  Getting this push from the pulpit, first-class people will frequently stoop</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>16\n</p>\n<p>to third-class tactics.  CEOs understandably do not find it easy to reject auditor-blessed strategies that lead to\nincreased future \xe2\x80\x9cearnings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>An example from the property-casualty insurance industry will illuminate the possibilities.  When a p-c\ncompany is acquired, the buyer sometimes simultaneously increases its loss reserves, often substantially.  This boost\nmay merely reflect the previous inadequacy of reserves \xe2\x80\x94 though it is uncanny how often an actuarial \xe2\x80\x9crevelation\xe2\x80\x9d\nof this kind coincides with the inking of a deal.  In any case, the move sets up the possibility of \xe2\x80\x98earnings\xe2\x80\x9d\nflowing into income at some later date, as reserves are released.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire has kept entirely clear of these practices: If we are to disappoint you, we would rather it be with\nour earnings than with our accounting.  In all of our acquisitions, we have left the loss reserve figures exactly\nas we found them.  After all, we have consistently joined with insurance managers knowledgeable about their\nbusiness and honest in their financial reporting.  When deals occur in which liabilities are increased immediately\nand substantially, simple logic says that at least one of those virtues must have been lacking \xe2\x80\x94 or, alternatively,\nthat the acquirer is laying the groundwork for future infusions of \xe2\x80\x9cearnings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s a true story that illustrates an all-too-common view in corporate America.  The CEOs of two large\nbanks, one of them a man who\xe2\x80\x99d made many acquisitions, were involved not long ago in a friendly merger\ndiscussion (which in the end didn\xe2\x80\x99t produce a deal).  The veteran acquirer was expounding on the merits of the\npossible combination, only to be skeptically interrupted by the other CEO: \xe2\x80\x9cBut won\xe2\x80\x99t that mean a huge charge,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe asked, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps as much as $1 billion?\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9csophisticate\xe2\x80\x9d wasted no words: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make it bigger than that\n\xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>A preliminary tally by R. G. Associates, of Baltimore, of special charges taken or announced during 1998\n\xe2\x80\x94 that is, charges for restructuring, in-process R&amp;D, merger-related items, and write-downs \xe2\x80\x94 identified no less\nthan 1,369 of these, totaling $72.1 billion.  That is a staggering amount as evidenced by this bit of perspective:\nThe 1997 earnings of the 500 companies in Fortune\xe2\x80\x99s famous list totaled $324 billion.\n</p>\n<p>Clearly the attitude of disrespect that many executives have today for accurate reporting is a business\ndisgrace.  And auditors, as we have already suggested, have done little on the positive side.  Though auditors\nshould regard the investing public as their client, they tend to kowtow instead to the managers who choose them\nand dole out their pay.  (\xe2\x80\x9cWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n</p>\n<p>A big piece of news, however, is that the SEC, led by its chairman, Arthur Levitt, seems determined to get\ncorporate America to clean up its act.  In a landmark speech last September, Levitt called for an end to \xe2\x80\x9cearnings\nmanagement.\xe2\x80\x9d  He correctly observed, \xe2\x80\x9cToo many corporate managers, auditors and analysts are participants in\na game of nods and winks.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then he laid on a real indictment: \xe2\x80\x9cManaging may be giving way to\nmanipulating; integrity may be losing out to illusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>I urge you to read the Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s speech (you can find it on the Internet at www.sec.gov) and to support\nhim in his efforts to get corporate America to deliver a straight story to its owners.  Levitt\xe2\x80\x99s job will be\nHerculean, but it is hard to think of another more important for him to take on.\n</p>\n<p>Reports to Shareholders\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Internet site, www.berkshirehathaway.com, has become a prime source for information about the\ncompany.  While we continue to send an annual report to all shareholders, we now send quarterlies only to those\nwho request them, letting others read these at our site.  In this report, we again enclose a card that can be\nreturned by those wanting to get printed quarterlies in 1999.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I have two simple goals in reporting: 1) We want to give you the information that we would\nwish you to give us if our positions were reversed; and 2) We want to make Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s information accessible\nto all of you simultaneously.  Our ability to reach that second goal is greatly helped by the Internet.\n</p>\n<p>In another portion of his September speech, Arthur Levitt deplored what he called \xe2\x80\x9cselective disclosure.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHis remarks were timely:  Today, many companies matter-of-factly favor Wall Street analysts and institutional</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>17\n</p>\n<p>investors in a variety of ways that often skirt or cross the line of unfairness.  These practices leave the great bulk\nof shareholders at a distinct disadvantage to a favored class.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, we regard the holder of one share of B stock as the equal of our large institutional investors.\nWe, of course, warmly welcome institutions as owners and have gained a number of them through the General\nRe merger.  We hope also that these new holders find that our owner\xe2\x80\x99s manual and annual reports offer them\nmore insights and information about Berkshire than they garner about other companies from the investor relations\ndepartments that these corporations typically maintain.  But if it is \xe2\x80\x9cearnings guidance\xe2\x80\x9d or the like that\nshareholders or analysts seek, we will simply guide them to our public documents.\n</p>\n<p>This year we plan to post our quarterly reports on the Internet after the close of the market on May 14,\nAugust 13, and November 12.  We also expect to put the 1999 annual report on our website on Saturday, March\n11, 2000, and to mail the print version at roughly the same time.\n</p>\n<p>We promptly post press releases on our website.  This means that you do not need to rely on the versions\nof these reported by the media but can instead read the full text on your computer.\n</p>\n<p>Despite the pathetic technical skills of your Chairman, I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to report that GEICO, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s,\nSee\xe2\x80\x99s, and The Buffalo News are now doing substantial business via the Internet.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve also recently begun to\noffer annuity products on our website.  This business was developed by Ajit Jain, who over the last decade has\npersonally accounted for a significant portion of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s operating earnings.  While Charlie and I sleep, Ajit\nkeeps thinking of new ways to add value to Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>Shareholder-Designated Contributions\n</p>\n<p>About 97.5% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire\'s 1998 shareholder-designated contributions\nprogram, with contributions totaling $16.9 million.  A full description of the program appears on pages 54-55.\n</p>\n<p>Cumulatively, over the 18 years of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $130 million pursuant\nto the instructions of our shareholders.  The rest of Berkshire\'s giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick\nto the philanthropic patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their former owners themselves\ntake on the responsibility for their personal charities).  In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of $12.5\nmillion in 1998, including in-kind donations of $2.0 million.\n</p>\n<p>To participate in future programs, you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the actual\nowner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so registered on August 31, 1999, will\nbe ineligible for the 1999 program.  When you get the contributions form from us, return it promptly so that it\ndoes not get put aside or forgotten.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored. \n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>This year\xe2\x80\x99s Woodstock for Capitalists will be held May 1-3, and we may face a problem.  Last year more\nthan 10,000 people attended our annual meeting, and our shareholders list has since doubled.  So we don\xe2\x80\x99t quite\nknow what attendance to expect this year.  To be safe, we have booked both Aksarben Coliseum, which holds\nabout 14,000 and the Holiday Convention Centre, which can seat an additional 5,000.  Because we know that our\nOmaha shareholders will want to be good hosts to the out-of-towners (many of them come from outside the U.S),\nwe plan to give those visitors first crack at the Aksarben tickets and to subsequently allocate these to greater\nOmaha residents on a first-come, first-served basis.  If we exhaust the Aksarben tickets, we will begin distributing\nHoliday tickets to Omaha shareholders.\n</p>\n<p>If we end up using both locations, Charlie and I will split our pre-meeting time between the two.\nAdditionally, we will have exhibits and also the Berkshire movie, large television screens and microphones at both\nsites.  When we break for lunch, many attendees will leave Aksarben, which means that those at Holiday can,\nif they wish, make the five-minute trip to Aksarben and finish out the day there.  Buses will be available to\ntransport people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have cars.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>18\n</p>\n<p>The doors will open at both locations at 7 a.m. on Monday, and at 8:30 we will premier the 1999 Berkshire\nmovie epic, produced by Marc Hamburg, our CFO.  The meeting will last from 9:30 until 3:30, interrupted only\nby the short lunch break.\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the badge\nyou will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have\nagain signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  In our normal fashion, we will run\nbuses from  the larger hotels to the meeting.  After the meeting, these will make trips back to the hotels and to\nNebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to find a car useful.\n</p>\n<p>The full line of Berkshire products will be available at Aksarben, and the more popular items will also be\nat Holiday.  Last year we set sales records across-the-board, moving 3,700 pounds of See\xe2\x80\x99s candy, 1,635 pairs of\nDexter shoes, 1,150 sets of Quikut knives and 3,104 Berkshire shirts and hats.  Additionally, $26,944 of World\nBook products were purchased as well as more than 2,000 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo.  Charlie\nand I are pleased but not satisfied with these numbers and confidently predict new records in all categories this\nyear.  Our 1999 apparel line will be unveiled at the meeting, so please defer your designer purchases until you\nview our collection.\n</p>\n<p>Dairy Queen will also be on hand and will again donate all proceeds to the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Miracle Network.\nLast  year we sold about 4,000 Dilly  bars, fudge bars and vanilla/orange bars.  Additionally, GEICO will have\xc2\xae\n</p>\n<p>a booth that will be manned by a number of our top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to\nsupply you with auto insurance quotes.  In almost all cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special\nshareholder\xe2\x80\x99s discount.  Check out whether we can save you some money.\n</p>\n<p>The piece de resistance of our one-company trade show will be a 79-foot-long, nearly 12-foot-wide, fully-\noutfitted cabin of a 737 Boeing Business Jet (\xe2\x80\x9cBBJ\xe2\x80\x9d), which is NetJets\xe2\x80\x99 newest product.  This plane has a 14-hour\nrange; is designed to carry 19 passengers; and offers a bedroom, an office, and two showers.  Deliveries to\nfractional owners will begin in the first quarter of 2000.\n</p>\n<p>The BBJ will be available for your inspection on May 1-3 near the entrance to the Aksarben hall.  You\nshould be able to minimize your wait by making your visit on Saturday or Sunday.  Bring along your checkbook\nin case you decide to make an impulse purchase.\n</p>\n<p>NFM\'s multi-stored complex, located on a 75-acre site about a mile from Aksarben, is open from 10 a.m.\nto 9 p.m. on weekdays, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  This operation did $300 million in\nbusiness during 1998 and offers an unrivaled breadth of merchandise \xe2\x80\x94 furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets\nand computers \xe2\x80\x94 all at can\xe2\x80\x99t-be-beat prices.  During the April 30th to May 4th period, shareholders presenting\ntheir meeting badge will receive a discount that is customarily given only to its employees.\n</p>\n<p>Borsheim\'s normally is closed on Sunday but will be open for shareholders from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on May\n2nd.  On annual meeting weekend last year, the store did an incredible amount of business.  Sales were double\nthose of the previous year, and the store\xe2\x80\x99s volume on Sunday greatly exceeded volume for any day in Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s\nhistory.  Charlie attributes this record to the fact that he autographed sales tickets that day and, while I have my\ndoubts about this proposition, we are not about to mess with a winning formula.  Please give him writer\xe2\x80\x99s cramp.\nOn last year\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s wrote 2,501 tickets during the eight hours it was open.  For those of you who\nare mathematically challenged, that is one ticket every 11\xc2\xbd seconds.\n</p>\n<p>Shareholders who wish to avoid Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s crowd can visit Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s on Saturday (10 a.m.-5:30 p.m.) or\non Monday (10 a.m.-8 p.m.).  Be sure to identify yourself as a Berkshire owner so that Susan Jacques, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s\nCEO, can quote you a \xe2\x80\x9dshareholder-weekend\xe2\x80\x9d price.  Susan joined us in 1983 as a $4-per-hour salesperson and\nwas made CEO in 1994.  This move ranks as one of my best managerial decisions.\n</p>\n<p>Bridge players can look forward to a thrill on Sunday, when Bob Hamman \xe2\x80\x94 the best the game has ever\nseen \xe2\x80\x94 will turn up to play with our shareholders in the mall outside of Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s.  Bob plays without sorting\nhis cards \xe2\x80\x94 hey, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with my game.  We will also have a couple of other tables at which\nanother expert or two will be playing.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>19\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 my favorite steakhouse \xe2\x80\x94 will again be open especially for Berkshire shareholders on the Sunday\nnight before the meeting.  Though Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s served from 4 p.m. until about 1 a.m. last year, its crew was swamped,\nand some of our shareholders had an uncomfortable wait.  This year fewer reservations will be accepted, and we\nask that you don\xe2\x80\x99t come on Sunday without a reservation.  In other years, many of our shareholders have chosen\nto visit Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on Friday, Saturday or Monday.  You can make reservations beginning on April 1 (but not before)\nby calling 402-551-3733.  The cognoscenti will continue to order rare T-bones with double orders of hash browns.\n</p>\n<p>The Omaha Golden Spikes (ne\xc3\xa9 the Omaha Royals) will meet the Iowa Cubs on Saturday evening, May 1st,\nat Rosenblatt Stadium.  Your Chairman, whose breaking ball had the crowd buzzing last year, will again take\nthe mound.  This year I plan to introduce my \xe2\x80\x9cflutterball.\xe2\x80\x9d  It\xe2\x80\x99s a real source of irritation to me that many view\nour annual meeting as a financial event rather than the sports classic I consider it to be.  Once the world sees\nmy flutterball, that misperception will be erased.\n</p>\n<p>Our proxy statement includes instructions about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of\nother information that should help you to enjoy your visit.  I particularly urge the 60,000 shareholders that we\ngained through the Gen Re merger to join us.  Come and meet your fellow capitalists.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be right to close without a word about the 11.8 people who work with me in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s\ncorporate office.
