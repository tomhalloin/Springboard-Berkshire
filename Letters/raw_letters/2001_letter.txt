Over the last 37 years (that is, since present management took over)\nper-share book value has grown from $19 to $37,920, a rate of 22.6% compounded annually.\xe2\x88\x97\n</p>\n<p>Per-share intrinsic grew somewhat faster than book value during these 37 years, and in 2001 it probably\ndecreased a bit less.  We explain intrinsic value in our Owner\xc2\x92s Manual, which begins on page 62.  I urge new\nshareholders to read this manual to become familiar with Berkshire\xc2\x92s key economic principles.\n</p>\n<p>Two years ago, reporting on 1999, I said that we had experienced both the worst absolute and relative\nperformance in our history.  I added that \xc2\x93relative results are what concern us,\xc2\x94 a viewpoint I\xc2\x92ve had since forming\nmy first investment partnership on May 5, 1956.  Meeting with my seven founding limited partners that evening, I\ngave them a short paper titled \xc2\x93The Ground Rules\xc2\x94 that included this sentence: \xc2\x93Whether we do a good job or a\npoor job is to be measured against the general experience in securities.\xc2\x94  We initially used the Dow Jones Industrials\nas our benchmark, but shifted to the S&amp;P 500 when that index became widely used.  Our comparative record since\n1965 is chronicled on the facing page; last year Berkshire\xc2\x92s advantage was 5.7 percentage points.\n</p>\n<p>Some people disagree with our focus on relative figures, arguing that \xc2\x93you can\xc2\x92t eat relative performance.\xc2\x94\nBut if you expect \xc2\x96 as Charlie Munger, Berkshire\xc2\x92s Vice Chairman, and I do \xc2\x96 that owning the S&amp;P 500 will\nproduce reasonably satisfactory results over time, it follows that, for long-term investors, gaining small advantages\nannually over that index must prove rewarding.  Just as you can eat well throughout the year if you own a profitable,\nbut highly seasonal, business such as See\xc2\x92s (which loses considerable money during the summer months) so, too,\ncan you regularly feast on investment returns that beat the averages, however variable the absolute numbers may be.\n</p>\n<p>Though our corporate performance last year was satisfactory, my performance was anything but.  I manage\nmost of Berkshire\xc2\x92s equity portfolio, and my results were poor, just as they have been for several years.  Of even\nmore importance, I allowed General Re to take on business without a safeguard I knew was important, and on\nSeptember 11th, this error caught up with us.  I\xc2\x92ll tell you more about my mistake later and what we are doing to\ncorrect it.\n</p>\n<p>Another of my 1956 Ground Rules remains applicable: \xc2\x93I cannot promise results to partners.\xc2\x94  But Charlie\nand I can promise that your economic result from Berkshire will parallel ours during the period of your ownership:\nWe will not take cash compensation, restricted stock or option grants that would make our results superior to yours.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, I will keep well over 99% of my net worth in Berkshire.  My wife and I have never sold a\nshare nor do we intend to.  Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which\nshareholders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters, and other higher-ups who fathered these\ndisasters have walked away with extraordinary wealth.  Indeed, many of these people were urging investors to buy\nshares while concurrently dumping their own, sometimes using methods that hid their actions. To their shame, these\nbusiness leaders view shareholders as patsies, not partners.\n</p>\n<p>Though Enron has become the symbol for shareholder abuse, there is no shortage of egregious conduct\nelsewhere in corporate America.  One story I\xc2\x92ve heard illustrates the all-too-common attitude of managers toward\n</p>\n<p>                                                          \n\xe2\x88\x97All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\'s A shares, the successor to the only stock that the\n</p>\n<p>company had outstanding before 1996.  The B shares have an ec onomic interest equal to 1/30th that of the A.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>4\n</p>\n<p>owners: A gorgeous woman slinks up to a CEO at a party and through moist lips purrs, \xc2\x93I\xc2\x92ll do anything \xc2\x96 anything\n\xc2\x96 you want.  Just tell me what you would like.\xc2\x94  With no hesitation, he replies, \xc2\x93Reprice my options.\xc2\x94\n</p>\n<p>One final thought about Berkshire: In the future we won\xc2\x92t come close to replicating our past record.  To be\nsure, Charlie and I will strive for above-average performance and will not be satisfied with less.  But two conditions\nat Berkshire are far different from what they once were: Then, we could often buy businesses and securities at much\nlower valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were then working with far less money than we now\nhave.  Some years back, a good $10 million idea could do wonders for us (witness our investment in Washington\nPost in 1973 or GEICO in 1976).  Today, the combination of ten such ideas and a triple in the value of each would\nincrease the net worth of Berkshire by only \xc2\xbc of 1%.  We need \xc2\x93elephants\xc2\x94 to make significant gains now \xc2\x96 and\nthey are hard to find.\n</p>\n<p>On the positive side, we have as fine an array of operating managers as exists at any company.  (You can\nread about many of them in a new book by Robert P. Miles: The Warren Buffett CEO.) In large part, moreover, they\nare running businesses with economic characteristics ranging from good to superb.  The ability, energy and loyalty\nof these managers is simply extraordinary.  We now have completed 37 Berkshire years without having a CEO of\nan operating business elect to leave us to work elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>Our star-studded group grew in 2001.  First, we completed the purchases of two businesses that we had\nagreed to buy in 2000 \xc2\x96 Shaw and Johns Manville.  Then we acquired two others, MiTek and XTRA, and\ncontracted to buy two more: Larson-Juhl, an acquisition that has just closed, and Fruit of the Loom, which will close\nshortly if creditors approve our offer.  All of these businesses are led by smart, seasoned and trustworthy CEOs.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, all of our purchases last year were for cash, which means our shareholders became owners of\nthese additional businesses without relinquishing any interest in the fine companies they already owned.  We will\ncontinue to follow our familiar formula, striving to increase the value of the excellent businesses we have, adding\nnew businesses of similar quality, and issuing shares only grudgingly.\n</p>\n<p>Acquisitions of 2001\n</p>\n<p>A few days before last year\xc2\x92s annual meeting, I received a heavy package from St. Louis, containing an\nunprepossessing chunk of metal whose function I couldn\xc2\x92t imagine. There was a letter in the package, though, from\nGene Toombs, CEO of a company called MiTek.  He explained that MiTek is the world\xc2\x92s leading producer of this\nthing I\xc2\x92d received, a \xc2\x93connector plate,\xc2\x94 which is used in making roofing trusses.  Gene also said that the U.K. parent\nof MiTek wished to sell the company and that Berkshire seemed to him the ideal buyer.  Liking the sound of his\nletter, I gave Gene a call.  It took me only a minute to realize that he was our kind of manager and MiTek our kind\nof business.  We made a cash offer to the U.K. owner and before long had a deal.\n</p>\n<p>Gene\xc2\x92s managerial crew is exceptionally enthusiastic about the company and wanted to participate in the\npurchase.  Therefore, we arranged for 55 members of the MiTek team to buy 10% of the company, with each\nputting up a minimum of $100,000 in cash.  Many borrowed money so they could participate.\n</p>\n<p>As they would not be if they had options, all of these managers are true owners.  They face the downside of\ndecisions as well as the upside.  They incur a cost of capital.  And they can\xc2\x92t \xc2\x93reprice\xc2\x94 their stakes: What they paid\nis what they live with.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I love the high-grade, truly entrepreneurial attitude that exists at MiTek, and we predict it will\nbe a winner for all involved.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>In early 2000, my friend, Julian Robertson, announced that he would terminate his investment partnership,\nTiger Fund, and that he would liquidate it entirely except for four large holdings.  One of these was XTRA, a\nleading lessor of truck trailers.  I then called Julian, asking whether he might consider selling his XTRA block or\nwhether, for that matter, the company\xc2\x92s management might entertain an offer for the entire company.  Julian\nreferred me to Lew Rubin, XTRA\xc2\x92s CEO.  He and I had a nice conversation, but it was apparent that no deal was to\nbe done.\n</p>\n<p>Then in June 2001, Julian called to say that he had decided to sell his XTRA shares, and I resumed\nconversations with Lew.  The XTRA board accepted a proposal we made, which was to be effectuated through a\ntender offer expiring on September 11th.  The tender conditions included the usual \xc2\x93out,\xc2\x94 allowing us to withdraw if</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>5\n</p>\n<p>the stock market were to close before the offer\xc2\x92s expiration.  Throughout much of the 11th, Lew went through a\nparticularly wrenching experience: First, he had a son-in-law working in the World Trade Center who couldn\xc2\x92t be\nlocated; and second, he knew we had the option of backing away from our purchase.  The story ended happily:\nLew\xc2\x92s son-in-law escaped serious harm, and Berkshire completed the transaction.\n</p>\n<p>Trailer leasing is a cyclical business but one in which we should earn decent returns over time.  Lew brings\na new talent to Berkshire, and we hope to expand in leasing.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>On December 3rd, I received a call from Craig Ponzio, owner of Larson-Juhl, the U.S. leader in custom-\nmade picture frames.  Craig had bought the company in 1981 (after first working at its manufacturing plant while\nattending college) and thereafter increased its sales from $3 million to $300 million.  Though I had never heard of\nLarson-Juhl before Craig\xc2\x92s call, a few minutes talk with him made me think we would strike a deal.  He was\nstraightforward in describing the business, cared about who bought it, and was realistic as to price.  Two days later,\nCraig and Steve McKenzie, his CEO, came to Omaha and in ninety minutes we reached an agreement.  In ten days\nwe had signed a contract.\n</p>\n<p>Larson-Juhl serves about 18,000 framing shops in the U.S. and is also the industry leader in Canada and\nmuch of Europe.  We expect to see opportunities for making complementary acquisitions in the future.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>As I write this letter, creditors are considering an offer we have made for Fruit of the Loom.  The company\nentered bankruptcy a few years back, a victim both of too much debt and poor management.  And, a good many\nyears before that, I had some Fruit of the Loom experience of my own.\n</p>\n<p>In August 1955, I was one of five employees, including two secretaries, working for the three managers of\nGraham-Newman Corporation, a New York investment company.  Graham-Newman controlled Philadelphia and\nReading Coal and Iron (\xc2\x93P&amp;R\xc2\x94), an anthracite producer that had excess cash, a tax loss carryforward, and a\ndeclining business.  At the time, I had a significant portion of my limited net worth invested in P&amp;R shares,\nreflecting my faith in the business talents of my bosses, Ben Graham, Jerry Newman and Howard (Micky) Newman.\n</p>\n<p>This faith was rewarded when P&amp;R purchased the Union Underwear Company from Jack Goldfarb for $15\nmillion.  Union (though it was then only a licensee of the name) produced Fruit of the Loom underwear.  The\ncompany possessed $5 million in cash \xc2\x96 $2.5 million of which P&amp;R used for the purchase \xc2\x96 and was earning about\n$3 million pre-tax, earnings that could be sheltered by the tax position of P&amp;R.  And, oh yes: Fully $9 million of the\nremaining $12.5 million due was satisfied by non-interest-bearing notes, payable from 50% of any earnings Union\nhad in excess of $1 million.  (Those were the days; I get goosebumps just thinking about such deals.)\n</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Union bought the licensor of the Fruit of the Loom name and, along with P&amp;R, was merged\ninto Northwest Industries.  Fruit went on to achieve annual pre-tax earnings exceeding $200 million.\n</p>\n<p>John Holland was responsible for Fruit\xc2\x92s operations in its most bountiful years.  In 1996, however, John\nretired, and management loaded the company with debt, in part to make a series of acquisitions that proved\ndisappointing.  Bankruptcy followed.  John was then rehired, and he undertook a major reworking of operations.\nBefore John\xc2\x92s return, deliveries were chaotic, costs soared and relations with key customers deteriorated.  While\ncorrecting these problems, John also reduced employment from a bloated 40,000 to 23,000.  In short, he\xc2\x92s been\nrestoring the old Fruit of the Loom, albeit in a much more competitive environment.\n</p>\n<p>Stepping into Fruit\xc2\x92s bankruptcy proceedings, we made a proposal to creditors to which we attached no\nfinancing conditions, even though our offer had to remain outstanding for many months.  We did, however, insist on\na very unusual proviso: John had to be available to continue serving as CEO after we took over.  To us, John and\nthe brand are Fruit\xc2\x92s key assets.\n</p>\n<p>I was helped in this transaction by my friend and former boss, Micky Newman, now 81.  What goes around\ntruly does come around.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>6\n</p>\n<p>Our operating companies made several \xc2\x93bolt-on\xc2\x94 acquisitions during the year, and I can\xc2\x92t resist telling you\nabout one.  In December, Frank Rooney called to tell me H.H. Brown was buying the inventory and trademarks of\nAcme Boot for $700,000.\n</p>\n<p>That sounds like small potatoes.  But \xc2\x96 would you believe it? \xc2\x96 Acme was the second purchase of P&amp;R, an\nacquisition that took place just before I left Graham-Newman in the spring of 1956.  The price was $3.2 million,\npart of it again paid with non-interest bearing notes, for a business with sales of $7 million.\n</p>\n<p>After P&amp;R merged with Northwest, Acme grew to be the world\xc2\x92s largest bootmaker, delivering annual\nprofits many multiples of what the company had cost P&amp;R.  But the business eventually hit the skids and never\nrecovered, and that resulted in our purchasing Acme\xc2\x92s remnants.\n</p>\n<p>In the frontispiece to Security Analysis, Ben Graham and Dave Dodd quoted Horace: \xc2\x93Many shall be\nrestored that now are fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor.\xc2\x94  Fifty-two years after I first read those lines,\nmy appreciation for what they say about business and investments continues to grow.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>In addition to bolt-on acquisitions, our managers continually look for ways to grow internally.  In that\nregard, here\xc2\x92s a postscript to a story I told you two years ago about R.C. Willey\xc2\x92s move to Boise.  As you may\nremember, Bill Child, R.C. Willey\xc2\x92s chairman, wanted to extend his home-furnishings operation beyond Utah, a\nstate in which his company does more than $300 million of business (up, it should be noted, from $250,000 when\nBill took over 48 years ago).  The company achieved this dominant position, moreover, with a \xc2\x93closed on Sunday\xc2\x94\npolicy that defied conventional retailing wisdom.  I was skeptical that this policy could succeed in Boise or, for that\nmatter, anyplace outside of Utah.  After all, Sunday is the day many consumers most like to shop.\n</p>\n<p>Bill then insisted on something extraordinary: He would invest $11 million of his own money to build the\nBoise store and would sell it to Berkshire at cost (without interest!) if the venture succeeded.  If it failed, Bill would\nkeep the store and eat the loss on its disposal.  As I told you in the 1999 annual report, the store immediately\nbecame a huge success \xe2\x80\x95 and it has since grown.\n</p>\n<p>Shortly after the Boise opening, Bill suggested we try Las Vegas, and this time I was even more skeptical.\nHow could we do business in a metropolis of that size and be closed on Sundays, a day that all of our competitors\nwould be exploiting?  Buoyed by the Boise experience, however, we proceeded to locate in Henderson, a\nmushrooming city adjacent to Las Vegas.\n</p>\n<p>The result: This store outsells all others in the R.C. Willey chain, doing a volume of business that far\nexceeds the volume of any competitor and that is twice what I had anticipated.  I cut the ribbon at the grand opening\nin October \xc2\x96 this was after a \xc2\x93soft\xc2\x94 opening and a few weeks of exceptional sales \xc2\x96 and, just as I did at Boise, I\nsuggested to the crowd that the new store was my idea.\n</p>\n<p>It didn\xc2\x92t work.  Today, when I pontificate about retailing, Berkshire people just say, \xc2\x93What does Bill\nthink?\xc2\x94  (I\xc2\x92m going to draw the line, however, if he suggests that we also close on Saturdays.)\n</p>\n<p>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Our main business \xc2\x97 though we have others of great importance \xc2\x97 is insurance.  To understand\nBerkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company.  The key\ndeterminants are: (1) the amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) most critical of all, the\nlong-term outlook for both of these factors.\n</p>\n<p>To begin with, float is money we hold but don\'t own.  In an insurance operation, float arises because\npremiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years.  During that\ntime, the insurer invests the money.  This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that\nan insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay.  That leaves it running an\n"underwriting loss," which is the cost of float.  An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less\nthan the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds.  But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is\nhigher than market rates for money.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>7\n</p>\n<p>Historically, Berkshire has obtained its float at a very low cost.  Indeed, our cost has been less than zero in\nabout half of the years in which we\xc2\x92ve operated; that is, we\xc2\x92ve actually been paid for holding other people\xc2\x92s money.\nOver the last few years, however, our cost has been too high, and in 2001 it was terrible.\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire\xc2\x92s\ninsurance operations since we entered the business 35 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company\n(whose traditional lines are included in the segment \xc2\x93Other Primary\xc2\x94).  For the table we have calculated our float \xc2\x97\nwhich we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume \xc2\x97 by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment\nreserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting insurance-\nrelated receivables, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.\n(Got that?)\n</p>\n<p>Yearend Float (in $ millions)\n</p>\n<p>Other Other\nYear GEICO General Re Reinsurance Primary Total\n</p>\n<p>1967 20 20\n1977 40 131 171\n1987 701 807 1,508\n1997 2,917 4,014 455 7,386\n1998 3,125 14,909 4,305 415 22,754\n1999 3,444 15,166 6,285 403 25,298\n2000 3,943 15,525 7,805 598 27,871\n2001 4,251 19,310 11,262 685 35,508\n</p>\n<p>Last year I told you that, barring a mega-catastrophe, our cost of float would probably drop from its 2000\nlevel of 6%.  I had in mind natural catastrophes when I said that, but instead we were hit by a man-made catastrophe\non September 11th \xc2\x96 an event that delivered the insurance industry its largest loss in history.  Our float cost therefore\ncame in at a staggering 12.8%.  It was our worst year in float cost since 1984, and a result that to a significant\ndegree, as I will explain in the next section, we brought upon ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>If no mega-catastrophe occurs, I \xc2\x96 once again \xc2\x96 expect the cost of our float to be low in the coming year.\nWe will indeed need a low cost, as will all insurers.  Some years back, float costing, say, 4% was tolerable because\ngovernment bonds yielded twice as much, and stocks prospectively offered still loftier returns.  Today, fat returns\nare nowhere to be found (at least we can\xc2\x92t find them) and short-term funds earn less than 2%.  Under these\nconditions, each of our insurance operations, save one, must deliver an underwriting profit if it is to be judged a\ngood business.  The exception is our retroactive reinsurance operation (a business we explained in last year\xc2\x92s annual\nreport), which has desirable economics even though it currently hits us with an annual underwriting loss of about\n$425 million.\n</p>\n<p>Principles of Insurance Underwriting\n</p>\n<p>When property/casualty companies are judged by their cost of float, very few stack up as satisfactory\nbusinesses.  And interestingly \xc2\x96 unlike the situation prevailing in many other industries \xc2\x96 neither size nor brand\nname determines an insurer\xc2\x92s profitability.  Indeed, many of the biggest and best-known companies regularly\ndeliver mediocre results.  What counts in this business is underwriting discipline.  The winners are those that\nunfailingly stick to three key principles:\n</p>\n<p>1. They accept only those risks that they are able to properly evaluate (staying within their circle of\ncompetence) and that, after they have evaluated all relevant factors including remote loss\nscenarios, carry the expectancy of profit.  These insurers ignore market-share considerations and\nare sanguine about losing business to competitors that are offering foolish prices or policy\nconditions.\n</p>\n<p>2. They limit the business they accept in a manner that guarantees they will suffer no aggregation of\nlosses from a single event or from related events that will threaten their solvency.  They\nceaselessly search for possible correlation among seemingly-unrelated risks.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>8\n</p>\n<p>3. They avoid business involving moral risk: No matter what the rate, trying to write good contracts\nwith bad people doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.  While most policyholders and clients are honorable and ethical,\ndoing business with the few exceptions is usually expensive, sometimes extraordinarily so.\n</p>\n<p>The events of September 11th made it clear that our implementation of rules 1 and 2 at General Re had been\ndangerously weak.  In setting prices and also in evaluating aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed\nthe possibility of large-scale terrorism losses.  That was a relevant underwriting factor, and we ignored it.\n</p>\n<p>In pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past and taken into account only costs we\nmight expect to incur from windstorm, fire, explosion and earthquake.  But what will be the largest insured property\nloss in history (after adding related business-interruption claims) originated from none of these forces.  In short, all\nof us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience, rather than exposure,\nthereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no premium.\n</p>\n<p>Experience, of course, is a highly useful starting point in underwriting most coverages.  For example, it\xc2\x92s\nimportant for insurers writing California earthquake policies to know how many quakes in the state during the past\ncentury have registered 6.0 or greater on the Richter scale.  This information will not tell you the exact probability\nof a big quake next year, or where in the state it might happen.  But the statistic has utility, particularly if you are\nwriting a huge statewide policy, as National Indemnity has done in recent years.\n</p>\n<p>At certain times, however, using experience as a guide to pricing is not only useless, but actually\ndangerous.  Late in a bull market, for example, large losses from directors and officers liability insurance (\xc2\x93D&amp;O\xc2\x94)\nare likely to be relatively rare.  When stocks are rising, there are a scarcity of targets to sue, and both questionable\naccounting and management chicanery often go undetected.  At that juncture, experience on high-limit D&amp;O may\nlook great.\n</p>\n<p>But that\xc2\x92s just when exposure is likely to be exploding, by way of ridiculous public offerings, earnings\nmanipulation, chain-letter-like stock promotions and a potpourri of other unsavory activities.  When stocks fall,\nthese sins surface, hammering investors with losses that can run into the hundreds of billions.  Juries deciding\nwhether those losses should be borne by small investors or big insurance companies can be expected to hit insurers\nwith verdicts that bear little relation to those delivered in bull-market days.  Even one jumbo judgment, moreover,\ncan cause settlement costs in later cases to mushroom.  Consequently, the correct rate for D&amp;O \xc2\x93excess\xc2\x94 (meaning\nthe insurer or reinsurer will pay losses above a high threshold) might well, if based on exposure, be five or more\ntimes the premium dictated by experience.\n</p>\n<p>Insurers have always found it costly to ignore new exposures.  Doing that in the case of terrorism,\nhowever, could literally bankrupt the industry.  No one knows the probability of a nuclear detonation in a major\nmetropolis this year (or even multiple detonations, given that a terrorist organization able to construct one bomb\nmight not stop there).  Nor can anyone, with assurance, assess the probability in this year, or another, of deadly\nbiological or chemical agents being introduced simultaneously (say, through ventilation systems) into multiple\noffice buildings and manufacturing plants.  An attack like that would produce astronomical workers\xc2\x92 compensation\nclaims.\n</p>\n<p>Here\xc2\x92s what we do know:\n</p>\n<p>(a) The probability of such mind-boggling disasters, though likely very low at present, is not zero.\n</p>\n<p>(b) The probabilities are increasing, in an irregular and immeasurable manner, as knowledge and\nmaterials become available to those who wish us ill.  Fear may recede with time, but the danger\nwon\xc2\x92t \xc2\x96 the war against terrorism can never be won.  The best the nation can achieve is a long\nsuccession of stalemates.  There can be no checkmate against hydra-headed foes.\n</p>\n<p>(c) Until now, insurers and reinsurers have blithely assumed the financial consequences from the\nincalculable risks I have described.\n</p>\n<p>(d) Under a \xc2\x93close-to-worst-case\xc2\x94 scenario, which could conceivably involve $1 trillion of damage,\nthe insurance industry would be destroyed unless it manages in some manner to dramatically limit\nits assumption of terrorism risks.  Only the U.S. Government has the resources to absorb such a\nblow.  If it is unwilling to do so on a prospective basis, the general citizenry must bear its own\nrisks and count on the Government to come to its rescue after a disaster occurs.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>9\n</p>\n<p>Why, you might ask, didn\xc2\x92t I recognize the above facts before September 11th?  The answer, sadly, is that I\ndid \xc2\x96 but I didn\xc2\x92t convert thought into action.  I violated the Noah rule: Predicting rain doesn\xc2\x92t count; building arks\ndoes.  I consequently let Berkshire operate with a dangerous level of risk \xc2\x96 at General Re in particular.  I\xc2\x92m sorry to\nsay that much risk for which we haven\xc2\x92t been compensated remains on our books, but it is running off by the day.\n</p>\n<p>At Berkshire, it should be noted, we have for some years been willing to assume more risk than any other\ninsurer has knowingly taken on.  That\xc2\x92s still the case.  We are perfectly willing to lose $2 billion to $2\xc2\xbd billion in a\nsingle event (as we did on September 11th) if we have been paid properly for assuming the risk that caused the loss\n(which on that occasion we weren\xc2\x92t).\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, we have a major competitive advantage because of our tolerance for huge losses.  Berkshire has\nmassive liquid resources, substantial non-insurance earnings, a favorable tax position and a knowledgeable\nshareholder constituency willing to accept volatility in earnings.  This unique combination enables us to assume\nrisks that far exceed the appetite of even our largest competitors.  Over time, insuring these jumbo risks should be\nprofitable, though periodically they will bring on a terrible year.\n</p>\n<p>The bottom-line today is that we will write some coverage for terrorist-related losses, including a few non-\ncorrelated policies with very large limits.  But we will not knowingly expose Berkshire to losses beyond what we\ncan comfortably handle.  We will control our total exposure, no matter what the competition does.\n</p>\n<p>Insurance Operations in 2001\n</p>\n<p>Over the years, our insurance business has provided ever-growing, low-cost funds that have fueled much\nof Berkshire\xc2\x92s growth.  Charlie and I believe this will continue to be the case.  But we stumbled in a big way in\n2001, largely because of underwriting losses at General Re.\n</p>\n<p>In the past I have assured you that General Re was underwriting with discipline \xc2\x96 and I have been proven\nwrong.  Though its managers\xc2\x92 intentions were good, the company broke each of the three underwriting rules I set\nforth in the last section and has paid a huge price for doing so.  One obvious cause for its failure is that it did not\nreserve correctly \xc2\x96 more about this in the next section \xc2\x96 and therefore severely miscalculated the cost of the product\nit was selling.  Not knowing your costs will cause problems in any business.  In long-tail reinsurance, where years\nof unawareness will promote and prolong severe underpricing, ignorance of true costs is dynamite.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, General Re was overly-competitive in going after, and retaining, business.  While all\nconcerned may intend to underwrite with care, it is nonetheless difficult for able, hard-driving professionals to curb\ntheir urge to prevail over competitors.  If \xc2\x93winning,\xc2\x94 however, is equated with market share rather than profits,\ntrouble awaits.  \xc2\x93No\xc2\x94 must be an important part of any underwriter\xc2\x92s vocabulary.\n</p>\n<p>At the risk of sounding Pollyannaish, I now assure you that underwriting discipline is being restored at\nGeneral Re (and its Cologne Re subsidiary) with appropriate urgency.  Joe Brandon was appointed General Re\xc2\x92s\nCEO in September and, along with Tad Montross, its new president, is committed to producing underwriting\nprofits.  Last fall, Charlie and I read Jack Welch\xc2\x92s terrific book, Jack, Straight from the Gut (get a copy!).  In\ndiscussing it, we agreed that Joe has many of Jack\xc2\x92s characteristics: He is smart, energetic, hands-on, and expects\nmuch of both himself and his organization.\n</p>\n<p>When it was an independent company, General Re often shone, and now it also has the considerable\nstrengths Berkshire brings to the table.  With that added advantage and with underwriting discipline restored,\nGeneral Re should be a huge asset for Berkshire.  I predict that Joe and Tad will make it so.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAt the National Indemnity reinsurance operation, Ajit Jain continues to add enormous value to Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>Working with only 18 associates, Ajit manages one of the world\xc2\x92s largest reinsurance operations measured by\nassets, and the largest, based upon the size of individual risks assumed.\n</p>\n<p>I have known the details of almost every policy that Ajit has written since he came with us in 1986, and\nnever on even a single occasion have I seen him break any of our three underwriting rules.  His extraordinary\ndiscipline, of course, does not eliminate losses; it does, however, prevent foolish losses.  And that\xc2\x92s the key: Just as\nis the case in investing, insurers produce outstanding long-term results primarily by avoiding dumb decisions, rather\nthan by making brilliant ones.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '9': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>10\n</p>\n<p>Since September 11th, Ajit has been particularly busy.  Among the policies we have written and retained\nentirely for our own account are (1) $578 million of property coverage for a South American refinery once a loss\nthere exceeds $1 billion; (2) $1 billion of non-cancelable third-party liability coverage for losses arising from acts of\nterrorism at several large international airlines; (3) \xc2\xa3500 million of property coverage on a large North Sea oil\nplatform, covering losses from terrorism and sabotage, above \xc2\xa3600 million that the insured retained or reinsured\nelsewhere; and (4) significant coverage on the Sears Tower, including losses caused by terrorism, above a $500\nmillion threshold.  We have written many other jumbo risks as well, such as protection for the World Cup Soccer\nTournament and the 2002 Winter Olympics.  In all cases, however, we have attempted to avoid writing groups of\npolicies from which losses might seriously aggregate.  We will not, for example, write coverages on a large number\nof office and apartment towers in a single metropolis without excluding losses from both a nuclear explosion and\nthe fires that would follow it.\n</p>\n<p>No one can match the speed with which Ajit can offer huge policies.  After September 11th, his quickness\nto respond, always important, has become a major competitive advantage.  So, too, has our unsurpassed financial\nstrength.  Some reinsurers \xc2\x96 particularly those who, in turn, are accustomed to laying off much of their business on a\nsecond layer of reinsurers known as retrocessionaires \xc2\x96 are in a weakened condition and would have difficulty\nsurviving a second mega-cat.  When a daisy chain of retrocessionaires exists, a single weak link can pose trouble for\nall.  In assessing the soundness of their reinsurance protection, insurers must therefore apply a stress test to all\nparticipants in the chain, and must contemplate a catastrophe loss occurring during a very unfavorable economic\nenvironment.  After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.  At Berkshire, we retain\nour risks and depend on no one.  And whatever the world\xc2\x92s problems, our checks will clear.\n</p>\n<p>Ajit\xc2\x92s business will ebb and flow \xc2\x96 but his underwriting principles won\xc2\x92t waver.  It\xc2\x92s impossible to\noverstate his value to Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nGEICO, by far our largest primary insurer, made major progress in 2001, thanks to Tony Nicely, its CEO,\n</p>\n<p>and his associates.  Quite simply, Tony is an owner\xc2\x92s dream.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO\xc2\x92s premium volume grew 6.6% last year, its float grew $308 million, and it achieved an\nunderwriting profit of $221 million.  This means we were actually paid that amount last year to hold the $4.25\nbillion in float, which of course doesn\xc2\x92t belong to Berkshire but can be used by us for investment.\n</p>\n<p>The only disappointment at GEICO in 2001 \xc2\x96 and it\xc2\x92s an important one \xc2\x96 was our inability to add\npolicyholders.  Our preferred customers (81% of our total) grew by 1.6% but our standard and non-standard policies\nfell by 10.1%.  Overall, policies in force fell .8%.\n</p>\n<p>New business has improved in recent months.  Our closure rate from telephone inquiries has climbed, and\nour Internet business continues its steady growth.  We, therefore, expect at least a modest gain in policy count\nduring 2002.  Tony and I are eager to commit much more to marketing than the $219 million we spent last year, but\nat the moment we cannot see how to do so effectively.  In the meantime, our operating costs are low and far below\nthose of our major competitors; our prices are attractive; and our float is cost-free and growing.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur other primary insurers delivered their usual fine results last year.  These operations, run by Rod\n</p>\n<p>Eldred, John Kizer, Tom Nerney, Michael Stearns, Don Towle and Don Wurster had combined premium volume of\n$579 million, up 40% over 2000.  Their float increased 14.5% to $685 million, and they recorded an underwriting\nprofit of $30 million.  In aggregate, these companies are one of the finest insurance operations in the country, and\ntheir 2002 prospects look excellent.\n</p>\n<p> \xe2\x80\x9cLoss Development\xe2\x80\x9d and Insurance Accounting\n</p>\n<p>Bad terminology is the enemy of good thinking.  When companies or investment professionals use terms\nsuch as \xc2\x93EBITDA\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93pro forma,\xc2\x94 they want you to unthinkingly accept concepts that are dangerously flawed.\n(In golf, my score is frequently below par on a pro forma basis: I have firm plans to \xc2\x93restructure\xc2\x94 my putting stroke\nand therefore only count the swings I take before reaching the green.)</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>11\n</p>\n<p>In insurance reporting, \xc2\x93loss development\xc2\x94 is a widely used term \xc2\x96 and one that is seriously misleading.\nFirst, a definition: Loss reserves at an insurer are not funds tucked away for a rainy day, but rather a liability\naccount.  If properly calculated, the liability states the amount that an insurer will have to pay for all losses\n(including associated costs) that have occurred prior to the reporting date but have not yet been paid.  When\ncalculating the reserve, the insurer will have been notified of many of the losses it is destined to pay, but others will\nnot yet have been reported to it.  These losses are called IBNR, for incurred but not reported.  Indeed, in some cases\n(involving, say, product liability or embezzlement) the insured itself will not yet be aware that a loss has occurred.\n</p>\n<p>It\xc2\x92s clearly difficult for an insurer to put a figure on the ultimate cost of all such reported and unreported\nevents.  But the ability to do so with reasonable accuracy is vital.  Otherwise the insurer\xc2\x92s managers won\xc2\x92t know\nwhat its actual loss costs are and how these compare to the premiums being charged.  GEICO got into huge trouble\nin the early 1970s because for several years it severely underreserved, and therefore believed its product (insurance\nprotection) was costing considerably less than was truly the case.  Consequently, the company sailed blissfully\nalong, underpricing its product and selling more and more policies at ever-larger losses.\n</p>\n<p>When it becomes evident that reserves at past reporting dates understated the liability that truly existed at\nthe time, companies speak of \xc2\x93loss development.\xc2\x94  In the year discovered, these shortfalls penalize reported\nearnings because the \xc2\x93catch-up\xc2\x94 costs from prior years must be added to current-year costs when results are\ncalculated.  This is what happened at General Re in 2001: a staggering $800 million of loss costs that actually\noccurred in earlier years, but that were not then recorded, were belatedly recognized last year and charged against\ncurrent earnings.  The mistake was an honest one, I can assure you of that.  Nevertheless, for several years, this\nunderreserving caused us to believe that our costs were much lower than they truly were, an error that contributed to\nwoefully inadequate pricing.  Additionally, the overstated profit figures led us to pay substantial incentive\ncompensation that we should not have and to incur income taxes far earlier than was necessary.\n</p>\n<p>We recommend scrapping the term \xc2\x93loss development\xc2\x94 and its equally ugly twin, \xc2\x93reserve strengthening.\xc2\x94\n(Can you imagine an insurer, upon finding its reserves excessive, describing the reduction that follows as \xc2\x93reserve\nweakening\xc2\x94?)  \xc2\x93Loss development\xc2\x94 suggests to investors that some natural, uncontrollable event has occurred in the\ncurrent year, and \xc2\x93reserve strengthening\xc2\x94 implies that adequate amounts have been further buttressed.  The truth,\nhowever, is that management made an error in estimation that in turn produced an error in the earnings previously\nreported.  The losses didn\xc2\x92t \xc2\x93develop\xc2\x94 \xc2\x96 they were there all along.  What developed was management\xc2\x92s\nunderstanding of the losses (or, in the instances of chicanery, management\xc2\x92s willingness to finally fess up).\n</p>\n<p>A more forthright label for the phenomenon at issue would be \xc2\x93loss costs we failed to recognize when they\noccurred\xc2\x94 (or maybe just \xc2\x93oops\xc2\x94).  Underreserving, it should be noted, is a common \xc2\x96 and serious \xc2\x96 problem\nthroughout the property/casualty insurance industry.  At Berkshire we told you of our own problems with\nunderestimation in 1984 and 1986.  Generally, however, our reserving has been conservative.\n</p>\n<p>Major underreserving is common in cases of companies struggling for survival.  In effect, insurance\naccounting is a self-graded exam, in that the insurer gives some figures to its auditing firm and generally doesn\xc2\x92t get\nan argument.  (What the auditor gets, however, is a letter from management that is designed to take his firm off the\nhook if the numbers later look silly.)  A company experiencing financial difficulties \xc2\x96 of a kind that, if truly faced,\ncould put it out of business \xc2\x96 seldom proves to be a tough grader.  Who, after all, wants to prepare his own\nexecution papers?\n</p>\n<p>Even when companies have the best of intentions, it\xc2\x92s not easy to reserve properly.  I\xc2\x92ve told the story in\nthe past about the fellow traveling abroad whose sister called to tell him that their dad had died.  The brother replied\nthat it was impossible for him to get home for the funeral; he volunteered, however, to shoulder its cost.  Upon\nreturning, the brother received a bill from the mortuary for $4,500, which he promptly paid.  A month later, and a\nmonth after that also, he paid $10 pursuant to an add-on invoice.  When a third $10 invoice came, he called his\nsister for an explanation.  \xc2\x93Oh,\xc2\x94 she replied, \xc2\x93I forgot to tell you.  We buried dad in a rented suit.\xc2\x94\n</p>\n<p>There are a lot of \xc2\x93rented suits\xc2\x94 buried in the past operations of insurance companies.  Sometimes the\nproblems they signify lie dormant for decades, as was the case with asbestos liability, before virulently manifesting\nthemselves.  Difficult as the job may be, it\xc2\x92s management\xc2\x92s responsibility to adequately account for all possibilities.\nConservatism is essential.  When a claims manager walks into the CEO\xc2\x92s office and says \xc2\x93Guess what just\nhappened,\xc2\x94 his boss, if a veteran, does not expect to hear it\xc2\x92s good news.  Surprises in the insurance world have\nbeen far from symmetrical in their effect on earnings.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>12\n</p>\n<p>Because of this one-sided experience, it is folly to suggest, as some are doing, that all property/casualty\ninsurance reserves be discounted, an approach reflecting the fact that they will be paid in the future and that\ntherefore their present value is less than the stated liability for them.  Discounting might be acceptable if reserves\ncould be precisely established.  They can\xc2\x92t, however, because a myriad of forces \xc2\x96 judicial broadening of policy\nlanguage and medical inflation, to name just two chronic problems \xc2\x96 are constantly working to make reserves\ninadequate.  Discounting would exacerbate this already-serious situation and, additionally, would provide a new\ntool for the companies that are inclined to fudge.\n</p>\n<p>I\xc2\x92d say that the effects from telling a profit-challenged insurance CEO to lower reserves through\ndiscounting would be comparable to those that would ensue if a father told his 16-year-old son to have a normal sex\nlife.  Neither party needs that kind of push.\n</p>\n<p>Sources of Reported Earnings\n</p>\n<p>The table that follows shows the main sources of Berkshire\'s reported earnings.  In this presentation,\npurchase-accounting adjustments (primarily relating to \xc2\x93goodwill\xc2\x94) are not assigned to the specific businesses to\nwhich they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown separately.  This procedure lets you view the earnings of\nour businesses as they would have been reported had we not purchased them.  In recent years, our \xc2\x93expense\xc2\x94 for\ngoodwill amortization has been large.  Going forward, generally accepted accounting principles (\xc2\x93GAAP\xc2\x94) will no\nlonger require amortization of goodwill.  This change will increase our reported earnings (though not our true\neconomic earnings) and simplify this section of the report.\n</p>\n<p>(in millions)\nBerkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Share\nof Net Earnings\n(after taxes and\n</p>\n<p>Pre-Tax Earnings Minority interests)\n2001 2000 2001 2000\n</p>\n<p>Operating Earnings:\nInsurance Group:\n</p>\n<p>Underwriting \xc2\x96 Reinsurance................................... $(4,318) $(1,416) $(2,824) $(911)\nUnderwriting \xc2\x96 GEICO .......................................... 221 (224) 144 (146)\nUnderwriting \xc2\x96 Other Primary ............................... 30 25 18 16\nNet Investment Income .......................................... 2,824 2,773 1,968 1,946\n</p>\n<p>Building Products(1)................................................... 461 34 287 21\nFinance and Financial Products Business ................. 519 530 336 343\nFlight Services........................................................... 186 213 105 126\nMidAmerican Energy (76% owned) ......................... 600 197 230 109\nRetail Operations....................................................... 175 175 101 104\nScott Fetzer (excluding finance operation) ............... 129 122 83 80\nShaw Industries(2) ...................................................... 292 -- 156 --\nOther Businesses ....................................................... 179 221 103 133\nPurchase-Accounting Adjustments ...........................

Brown\nand Justin swamped by losses at Dexter.\n</p>\n<p>I\xc2\x92ve made three decisions relating to Dexter that have hurt you in a major way:  (1) buying it in the first place;\n(2) paying for it with stock and (3) procrastinating when the need for changes in its operations was obvious.  I\nwould like to lay these mistakes on Charlie (or anyone else, for that matter) but they were mine.  Dexter, prior\nto our purchase \xc2\x96 and indeed for a few years after \xc2\x96 prospered despite low-cost foreign competition that was\nbrutal.  I concluded that Dexter could continue to cope with that problem, and I was wrong.\n</p>\n<p>We have now placed the Dexter operation \xc2\x96 which is still substantial in size \xc2\x96 under the management of Frank\nRooney and Jim Issler at H.H. Brown.  These men have performed outstandingly for Berkshire, skillfully\ncontending with the extraordinary changes that have bedeviled the footwear industry.  During part of 2002,\nDexter will be hurt by unprofitable sales commitments it made last year.  After that, we believe our shoe\nbusiness will be reasonably profitable.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 MidAmerican Energy, of which we own 76% on a fully-diluted basis, had a good year in 2001.  Its reported\nearnings should also increase considerably in 2002 given that the company has been shouldering a large\ncharge for the amortization of goodwill and that this \xc2\x93cost\xc2\x94 will disappear under the new GAAP rules.\n</p>\n<p>Last year MidAmerican swapped some properties in England, adding Yorkshire Electric, with its 2.1 million\ncustomers.  We are now serving 3.6 million customers in the U.K. and are its 2nd largest electric utility.  We\nhave an equally important operation in Iowa as well as major generating facilities in California and the\nPhilippines.\n</p>\n<p>At MidAmerican \xc2\x96 this may surprise you \xc2\x96 we also own the second-largest residential real estate brokerage\nbusiness in the country.  We are market-share leaders in a number of large cities, primarily in the Midwest, and\nhave recently acquired important firms in Atlanta and Southern California.  Last year, operating under various\nnames that are locally familiar, we handled about 106,000 transactions involving properties worth nearly $20\nbillion.  Ron Peltier has built this business for us, and it\xc2\x92s likely he will make more acquisitions in 2002 and\nthe years to come.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Considering the recessionary environment plaguing them, our retailing operations did well in 2001.  In\njewelry, same-store sales fell 7.6% and pre-tax margins were 8.9% versus 10.7% in 2000.  Return on invested\ncapital remains high.\n</p>\n<p>Same-store sales at our home-furnishings retailers were unchanged and so was the margin \xc2\x96 9.1% pre-tax \xc2\x96\nthese operations earned.  Here, too, return on invested capital is excellent.\n</p>\n<p>We continue to expand in both jewelry and home-furnishings.  Of particular note, Nebraska Furniture Mart is\nconstructing a mammoth 450,000 square foot store that will serve the greater Kansas City area beginning in\nthe fall of 2003.  Despite Bill Child\xc2\x92s counter-successes, we will keep this store open on Sundays.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The large acquisitions we initiated in late 2000 \xc2\x96 Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore \xc2\x96 all came\nthrough their first year with us in great fashion.  Charlie and I knew at the time of our purchases that we were\nin good hands with Bob Shaw, Jerry Henry and Yvan Dupuy, respectively \xc2\x96 and we admire their work even\nmore now.  Together these businesses earned about $659 million pre-tax.\n</p>\n<p>Shortly after yearend we exchanged 4,740 Berkshire A shares (or their equivalent in B shares) for the 12.7%\nminority interest in Shaw, which means we now own 100% of the company.  Shaw is our largest non-\ninsurance operation and will play a big part in Berkshire\xc2\x92s future.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 All of the income shown for Flight Services in 2001 \xc2\x96 and a bit more \xc2\x96 came from FlightSafety, our pilot-\ntraining subsidiary.  Its earnings increased 2.5%, though return on invested capital fell slightly because of the\n$258 million investment we made last year in simulators and other fixed assets.  My 84-year-old friend, Al\nUeltschi, continues to run FlightSafety with the same enthusiasm and competitive spirit that he has exhibited\nsince 1951, when he invested $10,000 to start the company.  If I line Al up with a bunch of 60-year-olds at the\nannual meeting, you will not be able to pick him out.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>14\n</p>\n<p>After September 11th, training for commercial airlines fell, and today it remains depressed.  However, training\nfor business and general aviation, our main activity, is at near-normal levels and should continue to grow.  In\n2002, we expect to spend $162 million for 27 simulators, a sum far in excess of our annual depreciation charge\nof $95 million.  Those who believe that EBITDA is in any way equivalent to true earnings are welcome to pick\nup the tab.\n</p>\n<p>Our NetJets\xc2\xae fractional ownership program sold a record number of planes last year and also showed a gain of\n21.9% in service income from management fees and hourly charges.  Nevertheless, it operated at a small loss,\nversus a small profit in 2000.  We made a little money in the U.S., but these earnings were more than offset by\nEuropean losses.  Measured by the value of our customers\xc2\x92 planes, NetJets accounts for about half of the\nindustry.  We believe the other participants, in aggregate, lost significant money.\n</p>\n<p>Maintaining a premier level of safety, security and service was always expensive, and the cost of sticking to\nthose standards was exacerbated by September 11th.  No matter how much the cost, we will continue to be the\nindustry leader in all three respects.  An uncompromising insistence on delivering only the best to his\ncustomers is embedded in the DNA of Rich Santulli, CEO of the company and the inventor of fractional\nownership.  I\xc2\x92m delighted with his fanaticism on these matters for both the company\xc2\x92s sake and my family\xc2\x92s: I\nbelieve the Buffetts fly more fractional-ownership hours \xc2\x96 we log in excess of 800 annually \xc2\x96 than does any\nother family.  In case you\xc2\x92re wondering, we use exactly the same planes and crews that serve NetJet\xc2\x92s other\ncustomers.\n</p>\n<p>NetJets experienced a spurt in new orders shortly after September 11th, but its sales pace has since returned to\nnormal.  Per-customer usage declined somewhat during the year, probably because of the recession.\n</p>\n<p>Both we and our customers derive significant operational benefits from our being the runaway leader in the\nfractional ownership business.  We have more than 300 planes constantly on the go in the U.S. and can\ntherefore be wherever a customer needs us on very short notice.  The ubiquity of our fleet also reduces our\n\xc2\x93positioning\xc2\x94 costs below those incurred by operators with smaller fleets.\n</p>\n<p>These advantages of scale, and others we have, give NetJets a significant economic edge over competition.\nUnder the competitive conditions likely to prevail for a few years, however, our advantage will at best produce\nmodest profits.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Our finance and financial products line of business now includes XTRA, General Re Securities (which is in a\nrun-off mode that will continue for an extended period) and a few other relatively small operations.  The bulk\nof the assets and liabilities in this segment, however, arise from a few fixed-income strategies, involving\nhighly-liquid AAA securities, that I manage.  This activity, which only makes sense when certain market\nrelationships exist, has produced good returns in the past and has reasonable prospects for continuing to do so\nover the next year or two.\n</p>\n<p>Investments\n</p>\n<p>Below we present our common stock investments.

As a group, our larger holdings have performed\npoorly in the last few years, some because of disappointing operating results.  Charlie and I still like the basic\nbusinesses of all the companies we own.  But we do not believe Berkshire\xc2\x92s equity holdings as a group are\nundervalued.\n</p>\n<p>Our restrained enthusiasm for these securities is matched by decidedly lukewarm feelings about the\nprospects for stocks in general over the next decade or so.  I expressed my views about equity returns in a speech I\ngave at an Allen and Company meeting in July (which was a follow-up to a similar presentation I had made two\nyears earlier) and an edited version of my comments appeared in a December 10th Fortune article.  I\xc2\x92m enclosing a\ncopy of that article.  You can also view the Fortune version of my 1999 talk at our website\nwww.berkshirehathaway.com.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I believe that American business will do fine over time but think that today\xc2\x92s equity prices\npresage only moderate returns for investors.  The market outperformed business for a very long period, and that\nphenomenon had to end.  A market that no more than parallels business progress, however, is likely to leave many\ninvestors disappointed, particularly those relatively new to the game.\n</p>\n<p>Here\xc2\x92s one for those who enjoy an odd coincidence: The Great Bubble ended on March 10, 2000 (though\nwe didn\xc2\x92t realize that fact until some months later).  On that day, the NASDAQ (recently 1,731) hit its all-time high\nof 5,132.  That same day, Berkshire shares traded at $40,800, their lowest price since mid-1997.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>During 2001, we were somewhat more active than usual in \xc2\x93junk\xc2\x94 bonds.  These are not, we should\nemphasize, suitable investments for the general public, because too often these securities live up to their name.  We\nhave never purchased a newly-issued junk bond, which is the only kind most investors are urged to buy.  When\nlosses occur in this field, furthermore, they are often disastrous: Many issues end up at a small fraction of their\noriginal offering price and some become entirely worthless.\n</p>\n<p>Despite these dangers, we periodically find a few \xc2\x96 a very few \xc2\x96 junk securities that are interesting to us.\nAnd, so far, our 50-year experience in distressed debt has proven rewarding.  In our 1984 annual report, we\ndescribed our purchases of Washington Public Power System bonds when that issuer fell into disrepute.  We\xc2\x92ve\nalso, over the years, stepped into other apparent calamities such as Chrysler Financial, Texaco and RJR Nabisco \xc2\x96\nall of which returned to grace.  Still, if we stay active in junk bonds, you can expect us to have losses from time to\ntime.\n</p>\n<p>Occasionally, a purchase of distressed bonds leads us into something bigger.  Early in the Fruit of the\nLoom bankruptcy, we purchased the company\xc2\x92s public and bank debt at about 50% of face value.  This was an\nunusual bankruptcy in that interest payments on senior debt were continued without interruption, which meant we\nearned about a 15% current return.  Our holdings grew to 10% of Fruit\xc2\x92s senior debt, which will probably end up\nreturning us about 70% of face value.  Through this investment, we indirectly reduced our purchase price for the\nwhole company by a small amount.\n</p>\n<p>In late 2000, we began purchasing the obligations of FINOVA Group, a troubled finance company, and\nthat, too, led to our making a major transaction.  FINOVA then had about $11 billion of debt outstanding, of which\nwe purchased 13% at about two-thirds of face value.  We expected the company to go into bankruptcy, but believed\nthat liquidation of its assets would produce a payoff for creditors that would be well above our cost.  As default\nloomed in early 2001, we joined forces with Leucadia National Corporation to present the company with a\nprepackaged plan for bankruptcy.\n</p>\n<p>The plan as subsequently modified (and I\xc2\x92m simplifying here) provided that creditors would be paid 70%\nof face value (along with full interest) and that they would receive a newly-issued 7\xc2\xbd% note for the 30% of their\nclaims not satisfied by cash.  To fund FINOVA\xc2\x92s 70% distribution, Leucadia and Berkshire formed a jointly-owned\nentity \xc2\x96 mellifluently christened Berkadia \xc2\x96 that borrowed $5.6 billion through FleetBoston and, in turn, re-lent this\nsum to FINOVA, concurrently obtaining a priority claim on its assets.  Berkshire guaranteed 90% of the Berkadia\nborrowing and also has a secondary guarantee on the 10% for which Leucadia has primary responsibility.  (Did I\nmention that I am simplifying?).</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="annotation"><a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/</a></div>\n</div>', '15': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>16\n</p>\n<p>There is a spread of about two percentage points between what Berkadia pays on its borrowing and what it\nreceives from FINOVA, with this spread flowing 90% to Berkshire and 10% to Leucadia.  As I write this, each loan\nhas been paid down to $3.9 billion.\n</p>\n<p>As part of the bankruptcy plan, which was approved on August 10, 2001, Berkshire also agreed to offer\n70% of face value for up to $500 million principal amount of the $3.25 billion of new 7\xc2\xbd% bonds that were issued\nby FINOVA.  (Of these, we had already received $426.8 million in principal amount because of our 13% ownership\nof the original debt.)  Our offer, which was to run until September 26, 2001, could be withdrawn under a variety of\nconditions, one of which became operative if the New York Stock Exchange closed during the offering period.\nWhen that indeed occurred in the week of September 11th, we promptly terminated the offer.\n</p>\n<p>Many of FINOVA\xc2\x92s loans involve aircraft assets whose values were significantly diminished by the events\nof September 11th.  Other receivables held by the company also were imperiled by the economic consequences of\nthe attack that day.  FINOVA\xc2\x92s prospects, therefore, are not as good as when we made our proposal to the\nbankruptcy court.  Nevertheless we feel that overall the transaction will prove satisfactory for Berkshire.  Leucadia\nhas day-to-day operating responsibility for FINOVA, and we have long been impressed with the business acumen\nand managerial talent of its key executives.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>It\xc2\x92s d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu time again: In early 1965, when the investment partnership I ran took control of Berkshire, that\ncompany had its main banking relationships with First National Bank of Boston and a large New York City bank.\nPreviously, I had done no business with either.\n</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 1969, when I wanted Berkshire to buy the Illinois National Bank and Trust of Rockford.\nWe needed $10 million, and I contacted both banks.  There was no response from New York.  However, two\nrepresentatives of the Boston bank immediately came to Omaha.  They told me they would supply the money for\nour purchase and that we would work out the details later.\n</p>\n<p>For the next three decades, we borrowed almost nothing from banks.  (Debt is a four-letter word around\nBerkshire.)  Then, in February, when we were structuring the FINOVA transaction, I again called Boston, where\nFirst National had morphed into FleetBoston.  Chad Gifford, the company\xc2\x92s president, responded just as Bill Brown\nand Ira Stepanian had back in 1969 \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93you\xc2\x92ve got the money and we\xc2\x92ll work out the details later.\xc2\x94\n</p>\n<p>And that\xc2\x92s just what happened.  FleetBoston syndicated a loan for $6 billion (as it turned out, we didn\xc2\x92t\nneed $400 million of it), and it was quickly oversubscribed by 17 banks throughout the world.  Sooooo . . . if you\never need $6 billion, just give Chad a call \xc2\x96 assuming, that is, your credit is AAA.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>One more point about our investments: The media often report that \xc2\x93Buffett is buying\xc2\x94 this or that security,\nhaving picked up the \xc2\x93fact\xc2\x94 from reports that Berkshire files.  These accounts are sometimes correct, but at other\ntimes the transactions Berkshire reports are actually being made by Lou Simpson, who runs a $2 billion portfolio for\nGEICO that is quite independent of me.  Normally, Lou does not tell me what he is buying or selling, and I learn of\nhis activities only when I look at a GEICO portfolio summary that I receive a few days after the end of each month.\nLou\xc2\x92s thinking, of course, is quite similar to mine, but we usually end up in different securities.  That\xc2\x92s largely\nbecause he\xc2\x92s working with less money and can therefore invest in smaller companies than I.  Oh, yes, there\xc2\x92s also\nanother minor difference between us: In recent years, Lou\xc2\x92s performance has been far better than mine.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>17\n</p>\n<p>Charitable Contributions\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire follows a highly unusual policy in respect to charitable contributions \xc2\x96 but it\xc2\x92s one that Charlie\nand I believe is both rational and fair to owners.\n</p>\n<p>First, we let our operating subsidiaries make their own charitable decisions, requesting only that the\nowners/managers who once ran these as independent companies make all donations to their personal charities from\ntheir own funds, instead of using company money.  When our managers are using company funds, we trust them to\nmake gifts in a manner that delivers commensurate tangible or intangible benefits to the operations they manage.\nLast year contributions from Berkshire subsidiaries totaled $19.2 million.\n</p>\n<p>At the parent company level, we make no contributions except those designated by shareholders.  We do\nnot match contributions made by directors or employees, nor do we give to the favorite charities of the Buffetts or\nthe Mungers.  However, prior to our purchasing them, a few of our subsidiaries had employee-match programs and\nwe feel fine about their continuing them: It\xc2\x92s not our style to tamper with successful business cultures.\n</p>\n<p>To implement our owners\xe2\x80\x99 charitable desires, each year we notify registered holders of A shares (A\xc2\x92s\nrepresent 86.6% of our equity capital) of a per-share amount that they can instruct us to contribute to as many as\nthree charities.  Shareholders name the charity; Berkshire writes the check.  Any organization that qualifies under\nthe Internal Revenue Code can be designated by shareholders.  Last year Berkshire made contributions of $16.7\nmillion at the direction of 5,700 shareholders, who named 3,550 charities as recipients.  Since we started this\nprogram, our shareholders\xc2\x92 gifts have totaled $181 million.\n</p>\n<p>Most public corporations eschew gifts to religious institutions.  These, however, are favorite charities of\nour shareholders, who last year named 437 churches and synagogues to receive gifts.  Additionally, 790 schools\nwere recipients.  A few of our larger shareholders, including Charlie and me, designate their personal foundations to\nget gifts, so that those entities can, in turn, disburse their funds widely.\n</p>\n<p>I get a few letters every week criticizing Berkshire for contributing to Planned Parenthood.  These letters\nare usually prompted by an organization that wishes to see boycotts of Berkshire products.  The letters are\ninvariably polite and sincere, but their writers are unaware of a key point: It\xc2\x92s not Berkshire, but rather its owners\nwho are making charitable decisions \xc2\x96 and these owners are about as diverse in their opinions as you can imagine.\nFor example, they are probably on both sides of the abortion issue in roughly the same proportion as the American\npopulation.  We\xc2\x92ll follow their instructions, whether they designate Planned Parenthood or Metro Right to Life, just\nas long as the charity possesses 501(c)(3) status.  It\xc2\x92s as if we paid a dividend, which the shareholder then donated.\nOur form of disbursement, however, is more tax-efficient.\n</p>\n<p>In neither the purchase of goods nor the hiring of personnel, do we ever consider the religious views, the\ngender, the race or the sexual orientation of the persons we are dealing with.  It would not only be wrong to do so, it\nwould be idiotic.  We need all of the talent we can find, and we have learned that able and trustworthy managers,\nemployees and suppliers come from a very wide spectrum of humanity.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>To participate in our future charitable contribution programs, you must own Class A shares that are\nregistered in the name of the actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so\nregistered on August 31, 2002 will be ineligible for the 2002 program.  When you get the contributions form from\nus, return it promptly.  Designations received after the due date will not be honored.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>18\n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>This year\xe2\x80\x99s annual meeting will be on Saturday, May 4, and we will again be at the Civic Auditorium.  The\ndoors will open at 7 a.m., the movie will begin at 8:30, and the meeting itself will commence at 9:30.  There will be\na short break at noon for food.  (Sandwiches can be bought at the Civic\xe2\x80\x99s concession stands.)  Except for that\ninterlude, Charlie and I will answer questions until 3:30.  Give us your best shot.\n</p>\n<p>For at least the next year, the Civic, located downtown, is the only site available to us.  We must therefore\nhold the meeting on either Saturday or Sunday to avoid the traffic and parking nightmare sure to occur on a\nweekday.  Shortly, however, Omaha will have a new Convention Center with plenty of parking facilities.  Assuming\nthat we then head for the Center, I will poll shareholders to see whether you wish to return to the Monday meeting\nthat was standard until 2000.  We will decide that vote based on a count of shareholders, not shares.  (This is not a\nsystem, however, we will ever institute to decide who should be CEO.)\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events.  As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we\nhave again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  They do a terrific job for us each\nyear, and I thank them for it.\n</p>\n<p>In our usual fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels to the meeting.  Afterwards, the buses will\nmake trips back to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim\xe2\x80\x99s and the airport.  Even so, you are likely to\nfind a car useful.\n</p>\n<p>We have added so many new companies to Berkshire this year that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail all of the\nproducts that we will be selling at the meeting.  But come prepared to carry home everything from bricks to candy.\nAnd underwear, of course.  Assuming our Fruit of the Loom purchase has closed by May 4, we will be selling\nFruit\xe2\x80\x99s latest styles, which will make you your neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s fashion leader.  Buy a lifetime supply.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them\nready to supply you with auto insurance quotes.  In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a special\nshareholder discount (usually 8%).  This special offer is permitted by 41 of the 49 jurisdictions in which we operate.\nBring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money.\n</p>\n<p>At the Omaha airport on Saturday, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets\xc2\xae available for your\ninspection.  Just ask a representative at the Civic about viewing any of these planes.  If you buy what we consider an\nappropriate number of items during the weekend, you may well need your own plane to take them home.  And, if\nyou buy a fraction of a plane, we might even throw in a three-pack of briefs or boxers.\n</p>\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 75-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will\nagain be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d pricing, which means we will be offering our shareholders a discount that is\ncustomarily given only to employees.  We initiated this special pricing at NFM five years ago, and sales during the\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeekend\xe2\x80\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $11.5 million in 2001.\n</p>\n<p>To get the discount, you must make your purchases on Thursday, May 2 through Monday, May 6 and also\npresent your meeting credential.  The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious\nmanufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but that, in the spirit of our shareholder\nweekend, have made an exception for you.  We appreciate their cooperation.

Shareholder prices will be available\nThursday through Monday, so if you wish to avoid the large crowds that will assemble on Friday evening and\nSunday, come at other times and identify yourself as a shareholder.  On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\nBorsheim\xe2\x80\x99s operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points below that of its major rivals, so the\nmore you buy, the more you save (or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what my wife and daughter tell me).

Show your sophistication by ordering a rare T-bone with a double\norder of hash browns.\n</p>\n<p>The usual baseball game will be held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.  This year the\nOmaha Royals will play the Oklahoma RedHawks.  Last year, in an attempt to emulate the career switch of Babe\nRuth, I gave up pitching and tried batting.  Bob Gibson, an Omaha native, was on the mound and I was terrified,\nfearing Bob\xe2\x80\x99s famous brush-back pitch.  Instead, he delivered a fast ball in the strike zone, and with a Mark\nMcGwire-like swing, I managed to connect for a hard grounder, which inexplicably died in the infield.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t run\nit out: At my age, I get winded playing a hand of bridge.\n</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what will take place at the ballpark this year, but come out and be surprised.

Berkshire added about 40,000 employees last year, bringing\nour workforce to 110,000.  At headquarters we added one employee and now have 14.8.  (I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried in vain to get\nJoEllen Rieck to change her workweek from four days to five; I think she likes the national recognition she gains by\nbeing .8.)\n</p>\n<p>The smooth handling of the array of duties that come with our current size and scope \xe2\x80\x93 as well as some\nadditional activities almost unique to Berkshire, such as our shareholder gala and designated-gifts program \xe2\x80\x93 takes a\nvery special group of people.  And that we most definitely have.\n</p>\n<p>Warren E. Buffett\nFebruary 28, 2002 Chairman of the Board</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>'}
