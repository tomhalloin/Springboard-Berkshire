In this table, Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s results\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using\nthe numbers originally reported.\n</p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire\nwere simply to have owned the S&amp;P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&amp;P 500\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&amp;P 500 in years when the index\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.\n</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '2': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n</p>\n<p>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n</p>\n<p>Our decrease in net worth during 2008 was $11.5 billion, which reduced the per-share book value of\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 9.6%. Over the last 44 years (that is, since present management took over)\nbook value has grown from $19 to $70,530, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.*\n</p>\n<p>The table on the preceding page, recording both the 44-year performance of Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s book value\nand the S&amp;P 500 index, shows that 2008 was the worst year for each. The period was devastating as well for\ncorporate and municipal bonds, real estate and commodities. By yearend, investors of all stripes were bloodied\nand confused, much as if they were small birds that had strayed into a badminton game.\n</p>\n<p>As the year progressed, a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great financial\ninstitutions was unveiled. This led to a dysfunctional credit market that in important respects soon turned\nnon-functional. The watchword throughout the country became the creed I saw on restaurant walls when I was\nyoung: \xe2\x80\x9cIn God we trust; all others pay cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>By the fourth quarter, the credit crisis, coupled with tumbling home and stock prices, had produced a\nparalyzing fear that engulfed the country. A freefall in business activity ensued, accelerating at a pace that I have\nnever before witnessed. The U.S. \xe2\x80\x93 and much of the world \xe2\x80\x93 became trapped in a vicious negative-feedback\ncycle. Fear led to business contraction, and that in turn led to even greater fear.\n</p>\n<p>This debilitating spiral has spurred our government to take massive action. In poker terms, the Treasury\nand the Fed have gone \xe2\x80\x9call in.\xe2\x80\x9d Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recently\nbeen dispensed by the barrel. These once-unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome\naftereffects. Their precise nature is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess, though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation.\nMoreover, major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by cities\nand states bearing mind-boggling requests. Weaning these entities from the public teat will be a political\nchallenge. They won\xe2\x80\x99t leave willingly.\n</p>\n<p>Whatever the downsides may be, strong and immediate action by government was essential last year if\nthe financial system was to avoid a total breakdown. Had one occurred, the consequences for every area of our\neconomy would have been cataclysmic. Like it or not, the inhabitants of Wall Street, Main Street and the various\nSide Streets of America were all in the same boat.\n</p>\n<p>Amid this bad news, however, never forget that our country has faced far worse travails in the past. In\nthe 20th Century alone, we dealt with two great wars (one of which we initially appeared to be losing); a dozen or\nso panics and recessions; virulent inflation that led to a 211\xe2\x81\x842% prime rate in 1980; and the Great Depression of\nthe 1930s, when unemployment ranged between 15% and 25% for many years. America has had no shortage of\nchallenges.\n</p>\n<p>Without fail, however, we\xe2\x80\x99ve overcome them. In the face of those obstacles \xe2\x80\x93 and many others \xe2\x80\x93 the\nreal standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven-fold during the 1900s, while the Dow Jones\nIndustrials rose from 66 to 11,497. Compare the record of this period with the dozens of centuries during which\nhumans secured only tiny gains, if any, in how they lived. Though the path has not been smooth, our economic\nsystem has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has, and it\nwill continue to do so. America\xe2\x80\x99s best days lie ahead.\n</p>\n<p>*All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s A shares. Figures for the B shares are\n1/30th of those shown for A.\n</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '3': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Take a look again at the 44-year table on page 2. In 75% of those years, the S&amp;P stocks recorded a\ngain. I would guess that a roughly similar percentage of years will be positive in the next 44. But neither Charlie\nMunger, my partner in running Berkshire, nor I can predict the winning and losing years in advance. (In our\nusual opinionated view, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone else can either.) We\xe2\x80\x99re certain, for example, that the economy will\nbe in shambles throughout 2009 \xe2\x80\x93 and, for that matter, probably well beyond \xe2\x80\x93 but that conclusion does not tell\nus whether the stock market will rise or fall.\n</p>\n<p>In good years and bad, Charlie and I simply focus on four goals:\n</p>\n<p>(1) maintaining Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s Gibraltar-like financial position, which features huge amounts of\nexcess liquidity, near-term obligations that are modest, and dozens of sources of earnings\nand cash;\n</p>\n<p>(2) widening the \xe2\x80\x9cmoats\xe2\x80\x9d around our operating businesses that give them durable competitive\nadvantages;\n</p>\n<p>(3) acquiring and developing new and varied streams of earnings;\n</p>\n<p>(4) expanding and nurturing the cadre of outstanding operating managers who, over the years,\nhave delivered Berkshire exceptional results.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire in 2008\n</p>\n<p>Most of the Berkshire businesses whose results are significantly affected by the economy earned below\ntheir potential last year, and that will be true in 2009 as well. Our retailers were hit particularly hard, as were our\noperations tied to residential construction. In aggregate, however, our manufacturing, service and retail\nbusinesses earned substantial sums and most of them \xe2\x80\x93 particularly the larger ones \xe2\x80\x93 continue to strengthen their\ncompetitive positions. Moreover, we are fortunate that Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s two most important businesses \xe2\x80\x93 our\ninsurance and utility groups \xe2\x80\x93 produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy. Both\nbusinesses delivered outstanding results in 2008 and have excellent prospects.\n</p>\n<p>As predicted in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report, the exceptional underwriting profits that our insurance businesses\nrealized in 2007 were not repeated in 2008. Nevertheless, the insurance group delivered an underwriting gain for\nthe sixth consecutive year. This means that our $58.5 billion of insurance \xe2\x80\x9cfloat\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 money that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to\nus but that we hold and invest for our own benefit \xe2\x80\x93 cost us less than zero. In fact, we were paid $2.8 billion to\nhold our float during 2008. Charlie and I find this enjoyable.\n</p>\n<p>Over time, most insurers experience a substantial underwriting loss, which makes their economics far\ndifferent from ours. Of course, we too will experience underwriting losses in some years. But we have the best\ngroup of managers in the insurance business, and in most cases they oversee entrenched and valuable franchises.\nConsidering these strengths, I believe that we will earn an underwriting profit over the years and that our float\nwill therefore cost us nothing. Our insurance operation, the core business of Berkshire, is an economic\npowerhouse.\n</p>\n<p>Charlie and I are equally enthusiastic about our utility business, which had record earnings last year\nand is poised for future gains. Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the managers of this operation, have achieved results\nunmatched elsewhere in the utility industry. I love it when they come up with new projects because in this\ncapital-intensive business these ventures are often large. Such projects offer Berkshire the opportunity to put out\nsubstantial sums at decent returns.\n</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '4': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Things also went well on the capital-allocation front last year. Berkshire is always a buyer of both\nbusinesses and securities, and the disarray in markets gave us a tailwind in our purchases. When investing,\npessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy.\n</p>\n<p>In our insurance portfolios, we made three large investments on terms that would be unavailable in\nnormal markets. These should add about $11\xe2\x81\x842 billion pre-tax to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s annual earnings and offer\npossibilities for capital gains as well. We also closed on our Marmon acquisition (we own 64% of the company\nnow and will purchase its remaining stock over the next six years). Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries made\n\xe2\x80\x9ctuck-in\xe2\x80\x9d acquisitions that will strengthen their competitive positions and earnings.\n</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the good news. But there\xe2\x80\x99s another less pleasant reality: During 2008 I did some dumb things in\ninvestments. I made at least one major mistake of commission and several lesser ones that also hurt. I will tell\nyou more about these later. Furthermore, I made some errors of omission, sucking my thumb when new facts\ncame in that should have caused me to re-examine my thinking and promptly take action.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, the market value of the bonds and stocks that we continue to hold suffered a significant\ndecline along with the general market. This does not bother Charlie and me. Indeed, we enjoy such price declines\nif we have funds available to increase our positions. Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that \xe2\x80\x9cPrice is what you\npay; value is what you get.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise\nwhen it is marked down.\n</p>\n<p>Yardsticks\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire has two major areas of value. The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash\nequivalents. At yearend those totaled $122 billion (not counting the investments held by our finance and utility\noperations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). About $58.5 billion of that total is funded by our\ninsurance float.\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and\ninsurance. These earnings are delivered by our 67 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 96. We exclude\nour insurance earnings from this calculation because the value of our insurance operation comes from the\ninvestable funds it generates, and we have already included this factor in our first bucket.\n</p>\n<p>In 2008, our investments fell from $90,343 per share of Berkshire (after minority interest) to $77,793, a\ndecrease that was caused by a decline in market prices, not by net sales of stocks or bonds. Our second segment\nof value fell from pre-tax earnings of $4,093 per Berkshire share to $3,921 (again after minority interest).\n</p>\n<p>Both of these performances are unsatisfactory. Over time, we need to make decent gains in each area if\nwe are to increase Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value at an acceptable rate. Going forward, however, our focus will be on\nthe earnings segment, just as it has been for several decades. We like buying underpriced securities, but we like\nbuying fairly-priced operating businesses even more.\n</p>\n<p>Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at the four major operating sectors of Berkshire. Each of these has vastly\ndifferent balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together, as is done in\nstandard financial statements, impedes analysis. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how\nCharlie and I view them.\n</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '5': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Regulated Utility Business\n</p>\n<p>Berkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide\nvariety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose\n3.8 million end users make it the U.K.\xe2\x80\x99s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which\nserves 723,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving\nabout 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines,\nwhich carry about 9% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.\n</p>\n<p>Our partners in ownership of MidAmerican are its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel,\nand my long-time friend, Walter Scott. It\xe2\x80\x99s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major moves\nonly when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Nine years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have\nreinforced my original belief: Berkshire couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have better partners.\n</p>\n<p>Somewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the\nU.S., HomeServices of America.

Here\xe2\x80\x99s some backup for that claim.\n</p>\n<p>Our two pipelines, Kern River and Northern Natural, were both acquired in 2002. A firm called Mastio\nregularly ranks pipelines for customer satisfaction. Among the 44 rated, Kern River came in 9th when we\npurchased it and Northern Natural ranked 39th. There was work to do.\n</p>\n<p>In Mastio\xe2\x80\x99s 2009 report, Kern River ranked 1st and Northern Natural 3rd. Charlie and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more\nproud of this performance. It came about because hundreds of people at each operation committed themselves to\na new culture and then delivered on their commitment.\n</p>\n<p>Achievements at our electric utilities have been equally impressive. In 1995, MidAmerican became the\nmajor provider of electricity in Iowa. By judicious planning and a zeal for efficiency, the company has kept\nelectric prices unchanged since our purchase and has promised to hold them steady through 2013.\n</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '6': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>MidAmerican has maintained this extraordinary price stability while making Iowa number one among\nall states in the percentage of its generation capacity that comes from wind. Since our purchase, MidAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s\nwind-based facilities have grown from zero to almost 20% of total capacity.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, when we purchased PacifiCorp in 2006, we moved aggressively to expand wind generation.\nWind capacity was then 33 megawatts. It\xe2\x80\x99s now 794, with more coming. (Arriving at PacifiCorp, we found\n\xe2\x80\x9cwind\xe2\x80\x9d of a different sort: The company had 98 committees that met frequently. Now there are 28. Meanwhile,\nwe generate and deliver considerably more electricity, doing so with 2% fewer employees.)\n</p>\n<p>In 2008 alone, MidAmerican spent $1.8 billion on wind generation at our two operations, and today the\ncompany is number one in the nation among regulated utilities in ownership of wind capacity. By the way,\ncompare that $1.8 billion to the $1.1 billion of pre-tax earnings of PacifiCorp (shown in the table as \xe2\x80\x9cWestern\xe2\x80\x9d)\nand Iowa. In our utility business, we spend all we earn, and then some, in order to fulfill the needs of our service\nareas. Indeed, MidAmerican has not paid a dividend since Berkshire bought into the company in early 2000. Its\nearnings have instead been reinvested to develop the utility systems our customers require and deserve. In\nexchange, we have been allowed to earn a fair return on the huge sums we have invested. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great partnership\nfor all concerned.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Our long-avowed goal is to be the \xe2\x80\x9cbuyer of choice\xe2\x80\x9d for businesses \xe2\x80\x93 particularly those built and owned\nby families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoid\nleveraging up acquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companies\nthrough thick and thin (though we prefer thick and thicker).\n</p>\n<p>Our record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path.\nFor them, acquisitions are \xe2\x80\x9cmerchandise.\xe2\x80\x9d Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators are\ncontemplating \xe2\x80\x9cexit strategies.\xe2\x80\x9d We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who truly\ncare about the future of their businesses.\n</p>\n<p>Some years back our competitors were known as \xe2\x80\x9cleveraged-buyout operators.\xe2\x80\x9d But LBO became a\nbad name. So in Orwellian fashion, the buyout firms decided to change their moniker. What they did not change,\nthough, were the essential ingredients of their previous operations, including their cherished fee structures and\nlove of leverage.\n</p>\n<p>Their new label became \xe2\x80\x9cprivate equity,\xe2\x80\x9d a name that turns the facts upside-down: A purchase of a\nbusiness by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductions in the equity portion of the acquiree\xe2\x80\x99s\ncapital structure compared to that previously existing. A number of these acquirees, purchased only two to three\nyears ago, are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private-equity buyers. Much of\nthe bank debt is selling below 70\xc2\xa2 on the dollar, and the public debt has taken a far greater beating. The private-\nequity firms, it should be noted, are not rushing in to inject the equity their wards now desperately need. Instead,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re keeping their remaining funds very private.\n</p>\n<p>In the regulated utility field there are no large family-owned businesses. Here, Berkshire hopes to be\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cbuyer of choice\xe2\x80\x9d of regulators. It is they, rather than selling shareholders, who judge the fitness of\npurchasers when transactions are proposed.\n</p>\n<p>There is no hiding your history when you stand before these regulators. They can \xe2\x80\x93 and do \xe2\x80\x93 call their\ncounterparts in other states where you operate and ask how you have behaved in respect to all aspects of the\nbusiness, including a willingness to commit adequate equity capital.\n</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '7': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>When MidAmerican proposed its purchase of PacifiCorp in 2005, regulators in the six new states we\nwould be serving immediately checked our record in Iowa. They also carefully evaluated our financing plans and\ncapabilities. We passed this examination, just as we expect to pass future ones.\n</p>\n<p>There are two reasons for our confidence. First, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel are going to run any\nbusinesses with which they are associated in a first-class manner. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any other way to operate.\nBeyond that is the fact that we hope to buy more regulated utilities in the future \xe2\x80\x93 and we know that our business\nbehavior in jurisdictions where we are operating today will determine how we are welcomed by new jurisdictions\ntomorrow.\n</p>\n<p>Insurance\n</p>\n<p>Our insurance group has propelled Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s growth since we first entered the business in 1967. This\nhappy result has not been due to general prosperity in the industry. During the 25 years ending in 2007, return on\nnet worth for insurers averaged 8.5% versus 14.0% for the Fortune 500. Clearly our insurance CEOs have not\nhad the wind at their back. Yet these managers have excelled to a degree Charlie and I never dreamed possible in\nthe early days. Why do I love them? Let me count the ways.\n</p>\n<p>At GEICO, Tony Nicely \xe2\x80\x93 now in his 48th year at the company after joining it when he was 18 \xe2\x80\x93\ncontinues to gobble up market share while maintaining disciplined underwriting. When Tony became CEO in\n1993, GEICO had 2.0% of the auto insurance market, a level at which the company had long been stuck. Now we\nhave a 7.7% share, up from 7.2% in 2007.\n</p>\n<p>The combination of new business gains and an improvement in the renewal rate on existing business\nhas moved GEICO into the number three position among auto insurers. In 1995, when Berkshire purchased\ncontrol, GEICO was number seven. Now we trail only State Farm and Allstate.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO grows because it saves money for motorists. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But virtually\neveryone likes to drive. So, sensibly, drivers look for the lowest-cost insurance consistent with first-class service.\nEfficiency is the key to low cost, and efficiency is Tony\xe2\x80\x99s specialty. Five years ago the number of policies per\nemployee was 299. In 2008, the number was 439, a huge increase in productivity.\n</p>\n<p>As we view GEICO\xe2\x80\x99s current opportunities, Tony and I feel like two hungry mosquitoes in a nudist\ncamp. Juicy targets are everywhere. First, and most important, our new business in auto insurance is now\nexploding. Americans are focused on saving money as never before, and they are flocking to GEICO. In January\n2009, we set a monthly record \xe2\x80\x93 by a wide margin \xe2\x80\x93 for growth in policyholders. That record will last exactly 28\ndays: As we go to press, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear February\xe2\x80\x99s gain will be even better.\n</p>\n<p>Beyond this, we are gaining ground in allied lines. Last year, our motorcycle policies increased by\n23.4%, which raised our market share from about 6% to more than 7%. Our RV and ATV businesses are also\ngrowing rapidly, albeit from a small base. And, finally, we recently began insuring commercial autos, a big\nmarket that offers real promise.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO is now saving money for millions of Americans. Go to GEICO.com or call 1-800-847-7536\nand see if we can save you money as well.\n</p>\n<p>General Re, our large international reinsurer, also had an outstanding year in 2008. Some time back,\nthe company had serious problems (which I totally failed to detect when we purchased it in late 1998). By 2001,\nwhen Joe Brandon took over as CEO, assisted by his partner, Tad Montross, General Re\xe2\x80\x99s culture had further\ndeteriorated, exhibiting a loss of discipline in underwriting, reserving and expenses. After Joe and Tad took\ncharge, these problems were decisively and successfully addressed. Today General Re has regained its luster.\nLast spring Joe stepped down, and Tad became CEO. Charlie and I are grateful to Joe for righting the ship and\nare certain that, with Tad, General Re\xe2\x80\x99s future is in the best of hands.\n</p>\n<p>8</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '8': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Reinsurance is a business of long-term promises, sometimes extending for fifty years or more. This\npast year has retaught clients a crucial principle: A promise is no better than the person or institution making it.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s where General Re excels: It is the only reinsurer that is backed by an AAA corporation. Ben Franklin once\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for an empty sack to stand upright.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s no worry for General Re clients.\n</p>\n<p>Our third major insurance operation is Ajit Jain\xe2\x80\x99s reinsurance division, headquartered in Stamford and\nstaffed by only 31 employees. This may be one of the most remarkable businesses in the world, hard to\ncharacterize but easy to admire.\n</p>\n<p>From year to year, Ajit\xe2\x80\x99s business is never the same. It features very large transactions, incredible\nspeed of execution and a willingness to quote on policies that leave others scratching their heads. When there is a\nhuge and unusual risk to be insured, Ajit is almost certain to be called.\n</p>\n<p>Ajit came to Berkshire in 1986. Very quickly, I realized that we had acquired an extraordinary talent.\nSo I did the logical thing: I wrote his parents in New Delhi and asked if they had another one like him at home.\nOf course, I knew the answer before writing. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone like Ajit.\n</p>\n<p>Our smaller insurers are just as outstanding in their own way as the \xe2\x80\x9cbig three,\xe2\x80\x9d regularly delivering\nvaluable float to us at a negative cost. We aggregate their results below under \xe2\x80\x9cOther Primary.\xe2\x80\x9d For space\nreasons, we don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss these insurers individually. But be assured that Charlie and I appreciate the\ncontribution of each.\n</p>\n<p>Here is the record for the four legs to our insurance stool. The underwriting profits signify that all four\nprovided funds to Berkshire last year without cost, just as they did in 2007. And in both years our underwriting\nprofitability was considerably better than that achieved by the industry. Of course, we ourselves will periodically\nhave a terrible year in insurance. But, overall, I expect us to average an underwriting profit. If so, we will be\nusing free funds of large size for the indefinite future.\n</p>\n<p>Underwriting Profit Yearend Float\n</p>\n<p>(in millions)\nInsurance Operations 2008 2007 2008 2007\n</p>\n<p>General Re . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 342 $ 555 $21,074 $23,009\nBH Reinsurance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,324 1,427 24,221 23,692\nGEICO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 916 1,113 8,454 7,768\nOther Primary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 210 279 4,739 4,229\n</p>\n<p>$2,792 $3,374 $58,488 $58,698\n</p>\n<p>Manufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations\n</p>\n<p>Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

It\xe2\x80\x99s also noteworthy that these operations used only minor\nfinancial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly we own some terrific businesses. We purchased many of\nthem, however, at large premiums to net worth \xe2\x80\x93 a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on our balance\nsheet \xe2\x80\x93 and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 8.1%.\n</p>\n<p>Though the full-year result was satisfactory, earnings of many of the businesses in this group hit the\nskids in last year\xe2\x80\x99s fourth quarter. Prospects for 2009 look worse. Nevertheless, the group retains strong earning\npower even under today\xe2\x80\x99s conditions and will continue to deliver significant cash to the parent company. Overall,\nthese companies improved their competitive positions last year, partly because our financial strength let us make\nadvantageous tuck-in acquisitions. In contrast, many competitors were treading water (or sinking).\n</p>\n<p>The most noteworthy of these acquisitions was Iscar\xe2\x80\x99s late-November purchase of Tungaloy, a leading\nJapanese producer of small tools. Charlie and I continue to look with astonishment \xe2\x80\x93 and appreciation! \xe2\x80\x93 at the\naccomplishments of Iscar\xe2\x80\x99s management. To secure one manager like Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz or Danny\nGoldman when we acquire a company is a blessing. Getting three is like winning the Triple Crown. Iscar\xe2\x80\x99s\ngrowth since our purchase has exceeded our expectations \xe2\x80\x93 which were high \xe2\x80\x93 and the addition of Tungaloy will\nmove performance to the next level.\n</p>\n<p>MiTek, Benjamin Moore, Acme Brick, Forest River, Marmon and CTB also made one or more\nacquisitions during the year. CTB, which operates worldwide in the agriculture equipment field, has now picked\nup six small firms since we purchased it in 2002. At that time, we paid $140 million for the company. Last year\nits pre-tax earnings were $89 million. Vic Mancinelli, its CEO, followed Berkshire-like operating principles long\nbefore our arrival. He focuses on blocking and tackling, day by day doing the little things right and never getting\noff course. Ten years from now, Vic will be running a much larger operation and, more important, will be\nearning excellent returns on invested capital.\n</p>\n<p>Finance and Financial Products\n</p>\n<p>I will write here at some length about the mortgage operation of Clayton Homes and skip any financial\ncommentary, which is summarized in the table at the end of this section. I do this because Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s recent\nexperience may be useful in the public-policy debate about housing and mortgages. But first a little background.\n</p>\n<p>Clayton is the largest company in the manufactured home industry, delivering 27,499 units last year.\nThis came to about 34% of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s 81,889 total. Our share will likely grow in 2009, partly because much\nof the rest of the industry is in acute distress. Industrywide, units sold have steadily declined since they hit a peak\nof 372,843 in 1998.\n</p>\n<p>10</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '10': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>At that time, much of the industry employed sales practices that were atrocious. Writing about the\nperiod somewhat later, I described it as involving \xe2\x80\x9cborrowers who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have borrowed being financed by\nlenders who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>To begin with, the need for meaningful down payments was frequently ignored. Sometimes fakery was\ninvolved. (\xe2\x80\x9cThat certainly looks like a $2,000 cat to me\xe2\x80\x9d says the salesman who will receive a $3,000\ncommission if the loan goes through.) Moreover, impossible-to-meet monthly payments were being agreed to by\nborrowers who signed up because they had nothing to lose. The resulting mortgages were usually packaged\n(\xe2\x80\x9csecuritized\xe2\x80\x9d) and sold by Wall Street firms to unsuspecting investors. This chain of folly had to end badly, and\nit did.\n</p>\n<p>Clayton, it should be emphasized, followed far more sensible practices in its own lending throughout\nthat time. Indeed, no purchaser of the mortgages it originated and then securitized has ever lost a dime of\nprincipal or interest. But Clayton was the exception; industry losses were staggering. And the hangover continues\nto this day.\n</p>\n<p>This 1997-2000 fiasco should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-larger\nconventional housing market. But investors, government and rating agencies learned exactly nothing from the\nmanufactured-home debacle. Instead, in an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated with\nconventional homes in the 2004-07 period: Lenders happily made loans that borrowers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t repay out of their\nincomes, and borrowers just as happily signed up to meet those payments. Both parties counted on \xe2\x80\x9chouse-price\nappreciation\xe2\x80\x9d to make this otherwise impossible arrangement work. It was Scarlett O\xe2\x80\x99Hara all over again: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\nthink about it tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d The consequences of this behavior are now reverberating through every corner of our\neconomy.\n</p>\n<p>Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s 198,888 borrowers, however, have continued to pay normally throughout the housing crash,\nhanding us no unexpected losses. This is not because these borrowers are unusually creditworthy, a point proved\nby FICO scores (a standard measure of credit risk). Their median FICO score is 644, compared to a national\nmedian of 723, and about 35% are below 620, the segment usually designated \xe2\x80\x9csub-prime.\xe2\x80\x9d Many disastrous\npools of mortgages on conventional homes are populated by borrowers with far better credit, as measured by\nFICO scores.\n</p>\n<p>Yet at yearend, our delinquency rate on loans we have originated was 3.6%, up only modestly from\n2.9% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2004. (In addition to our originated loans, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also bought bulk portfolios of various\ntypes from other financial institutions.) Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s foreclosures during 2008 were 3.0% of originated loans\ncompared to 3.8% in 2006 and 5.3% in 2004.\n</p>\n<p>Why are our borrowers \xe2\x80\x93 characteristically people with modest incomes and far-from-great credit\nscores \xe2\x80\x93 performing so well? The answer is elementary, going right back to Lending 101. Our borrowers simply\nlooked at how full-bore mortgage payments would compare with their actual \xe2\x80\x93 not hoped-for \xe2\x80\x93 income and then\ndecided whether they could live with that commitment. Simply put, they took out a mortgage with the intention\nof paying it off, whatever the course of home prices.\n</p>\n<p>Just as important is what our borrowers did not do. They did not count on making their loan payments\nby means of refinancing. They did not sign up for \xe2\x80\x9cteaser\xe2\x80\x9d rates that upon reset were outsized relative to their\nincome. And they did not assume that they could always sell their home at a profit if their mortgage payments\nbecame onerous. Jimmy Stewart would have loved these folks.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, a number of our borrowers will run into trouble. They generally have no more than minor\nsavings to tide them over if adversity hits. The major cause of delinquency or foreclosure is the loss of a job, but\ndeath, divorce and medical expenses all cause problems. If unemployment rates rise \xe2\x80\x93 as they surely will in\n2009 \xe2\x80\x93 more of Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s borrowers will have troubles, and we will have larger, though still manageable, losses.\nBut our problems will not be driven to any extent by the trend of home prices.\n</p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '11': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Commentary about the current housing crisis often ignores the crucial fact that most foreclosures do\nnot occur because a house is worth less than its mortgage (so-called \xe2\x80\x9cupside-down\xe2\x80\x9d loans). Rather, foreclosures\ntake place because borrowers can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the monthly payment that they agreed to pay. Homeowners who have\nmade a meaningful down-payment \xe2\x80\x93 derived from savings and not from other borrowing \xe2\x80\x93 seldom walk away\nfrom a primary residence simply because its value today is less than the mortgage. Instead, they walk when they\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make the monthly payments.\n</p>\n<p>Home ownership is a wonderful thing. My family and I have enjoyed my present home for 50 years,\nwith more to come. But enjoyment and utility should be the primary motives for purchase, not profit or refi\npossibilities. And the home purchased ought to fit the income of the purchaser.\n</p>\n<p>The present housing debacle should teach home buyers, lenders, brokers and government some simple\nlessons that will ensure stability in the future. Home purchases should involve an honest-to-God down payment\nof at least 10% and monthly payments that can be comfortably handled by the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s income. That income\nshould be carefully verified.\n</p>\n<p>Putting people into homes, though a desirable goal, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be our country\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective.\nKeeping them in their homes should be the ambition.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s lending operation, though not damaged by the performance of its borrowers, is nevertheless\nthreatened by an element of the credit crisis. Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee \xe2\x80\x93\nbanks with FDIC-insured deposits, large entities with commercial paper now backed by the Federal Reserve, and\nothers who are using imaginative methods (or lobbying skills) to come under the government\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella \xe2\x80\x93 have\nmoney costs that are minimal. Conversely, highly-rated companies, such as Berkshire, are experiencing\nborrowing costs that, in relation to Treasury rates, are at record levels. Moreover, funds are abundant for the\ngovernment-guaranteed borrower but often scarce for others, no matter how creditworthy they may be.\n</p>\n<p>This unprecedented \xe2\x80\x9cspread\xe2\x80\x9d in the cost of money makes it unprofitable for any lender who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nenjoy government-guaranteed funds to go up against those with a favored status. Government is determining the\n\xe2\x80\x9chaves\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chave-nots.\xe2\x80\x9d That is why companies are rushing to convert to bank holding companies, not a course\nfeasible for Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>Though Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s credit is pristine \xe2\x80\x93 we are one of only seven AAA corporations in the country \xe2\x80\x93 our\ncost of borrowing is now far higher than competitors with shaky balance sheets but government backing.

BHAC insures these securities for issuers both\nat the time their bonds are sold to the public (primary transactions) and later, when the bonds are already owned\nby investors (secondary transactions).\n</p>\n<p>By yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business had\nall fallen into big trouble. The cause of their problems was captured long ago by Mae West: \xe2\x80\x9cI was Snow White,\nbut I drifted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>The monolines (as the bond insurers are called) initially insured only tax-exempt bonds that were\nlow-risk. But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell. Faced with the prospect of\nstagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever-riskier propositions. Some of these\ninvolved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations. When housing prices plummeted, the monoline\nindustry quickly became a basket case.\n</p>\n<p>Early in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax-exempts that was on\nthe books of the three largest monolines. These companies were all in life-threatening trouble (though they said\notherwise.) We would have charged a 11\xe2\x81\x842% rate to take over the guarantees on about $822 billion of bonds. If\nour offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who owned\nthese bonds \xe2\x80\x93 a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases. Ours was not a frivolous proposal: For reasons\nwe will come to later, it involved substantial risk for Berkshire.\n</p>\n<p>The monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two. In the end,\nthough, the turndowns proved to be very good news for us, because it became apparent that I had severely\nunderpriced our offer.\n</p>\n<p>Thereafter, we wrote about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the punch\nline: About 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementioned\nmonolines. In these agreements, we have to pay for defaults only if the original insurer is financially unable to do\nso.\n</p>\n<p>We wrote this \xe2\x80\x9csecond-to-pay\xe2\x80\x9d insurance for rates averaging 3.3%. That\xe2\x80\x99s right; we have been paid far\nmore for becoming the second to pay than the 1.5% we would have earlier charged to be the first to pay. In one\nextreme case, we actually agreed to be fourth to pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1% premium\ncharged by the monoline that remains first to pay. In other words, three other monolines have to first go broke\nbefore we need to write a check.\n</p>\n<p>Two of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital.\nThis, of course, directly helps us, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term,\nany claims on our second-to-pay insurance because these two monolines fail. In addition to our book of\nsecondary business, we have also written $3.7 billion of primary business for a premium of $96 million. In\nprimary business, of course, we are first to pay if the issuer gets in trouble.\n</p>\n<p>We have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any other\nmonoline. Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs. This explains why many sophisticated\ninvestors have bought second-to-pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by another\nmonoline. BHAC has become not only the insurer of preference, but in many cases the sole insurer acceptable to\nbondholders.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a sure\nthing that this insurance will ultimately be profitable for us. The reason is simple, though I have never seen even\na passing reference to it by any financial analyst, rating agency or monoline CEO.\n</p>\n<p>13</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '13': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax-exempts has been that defaults have\nhistorically been few. But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsured bonds.\nInsurance of tax-exempt bonds didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist before 1971, and even after that most bonds remained uninsured.\n</p>\n<p>A universe of tax-exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat different\nloss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being how different.\nTo understand why, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy. At the time its\nbonds \xe2\x80\x93 virtually all uninsured \xe2\x80\x93 were heavily held by the city\xe2\x80\x99s wealthier residents as well as by New York\nbanks and other institutions. These local bondholders deeply desired to solve the city\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal problems. So before\nlong, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution. Without one, it\nwas apparent to all that New York\xe2\x80\x99s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severe\nfinancial losses from their bond holdings.\n</p>\n<p>Now, imagine that all of the city\xe2\x80\x99s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire. Would similar belt-\ntightening, tax increases, labor concessions, etc. have been forthcoming? Of course not. At a minimum, Berkshire\nwould have been asked to \xe2\x80\x9cshare\xe2\x80\x9d in the required sacrifices. And, considering our deep pockets, the required\ncontribution would most certainly have been substantial.\n</p>\n<p>Local governments are going to face far tougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date.\nThe pension liabilities I talked about in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report will be a huge contributor to these woes. Many cities\nand states were surely horrified when they inspected the status of their funding at yearend 2008. The gap between\nassets and a realistic actuarial valuation of present liabilities is simply staggering.\n</p>\n<p>When faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will be\nmore prone to develop \xe2\x80\x9csolutions\xe2\x80\x9d less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsured\nbonds held by local banks and residents. Losses in the tax-exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to be\nhighly correlated among issuers. If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance that\nothers will follow in their footsteps will grow. What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to local\ncitizens in the form of major tax increases over pain to a far-away bond insurer?\n</p>\n<p>Insuring tax-exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business \xe2\x80\x93 one with similarities, in\nfact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes. In both cases, a string of loss-free years can be followed by a\ndevastating experience that more than wipes out all earlier profits. We will try, therefore, to proceed carefully in\nthis business, eschewing many classes of bonds that other monolines regularly embrace.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>The type of fallacy involved in projecting loss experience from a universe of non-insured bonds onto a\ndeceptively-similar universe in which many bonds are insured pops up in other areas of finance. \xe2\x80\x9cBack-tested\xe2\x80\x9d\nmodels of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error. Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financial\nmarkets as guides to future action. (If merely looking up past financial data would tell you what the future holds,\nthe Forbes 400 would consist of librarians.)\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed,\nhistory-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors. These parties looked at loss experience\nover periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then made\nthis experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had\nrecently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford.\nIn short, universe \xe2\x80\x9cpast\xe2\x80\x9d and universe \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent\xe2\x80\x9d had very different characteristics. But lenders, government and\nmedia largely failed to recognize this all-important fact.\n</p>\n<p>14</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '14': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Investors should be skeptical of history-based models.

You will also see our share of their earnings (less applicable\ntaxes) regularly included in our quarterly and annual earnings.\n</p>\n<p>I told you in an earlier part of this report that last year I made a major mistake of commission (and\nmaybe more; this one sticks out). Without urging from Charlie or anyone else, I bought a large amount of\nConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in\nenergy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in\nthe future than the current $40-$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise,\nmoreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.\n</p>\n<p>I made some other already-recognizable errors as well. They were smaller, but unfortunately not that\nsmall. During 2008, I spent $244 million for shares of two Irish banks that appeared cheap to me. At yearend we\nwrote these holdings down to market: $27 million, for an 89% loss. Since then, the two stocks have declined\neven further. The tennis crowd would call my mistakes \xe2\x80\x9cunforced errors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>On the plus side last year, we made purchases totaling $14.5 billion in fixed-income securities issued\nby Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. We very much like these commitments, which carry high\ncurrent yields that, in themselves, make the investments more than satisfactory. But in each of these three\npurchases, we also acquired a substantial equity participation as a bonus. To fund these large purchases, I had to\nsell portions of some holdings that I would have preferred to keep (primarily Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp;\nGamble and ConocoPhillips). However, I have pledged \xe2\x80\x93 to you, the rating agencies and myself \xe2\x80\x93 to always run\nBerkshire with more than ample cash. We never want to count on the kindness of strangers in order to meet\ntomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s obligations. When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep for the chance of extra\nprofits.\n</p>\n<p>The investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it. This change has not been\nminor; the pendulum has covered an extraordinary arc. A few years ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that\nyields like today\xe2\x80\x99s could have been obtained on good-grade municipal or corporate bonds even while risk-free\ngovernments offered near-zero returns on short-term bonds and no better than a pittance on long-terms. When the\nfinancial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the\nhousing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost\nequally extraordinary.\n</p>\n<p>Clinging to cash equivalents or long-term government bonds at present yields is almost certainly a\nterrible policy if continued for long. Holders of these instruments, of course, have felt increasingly comfortable \xe2\x80\x93\nin fact, almost smug \xe2\x80\x93 in following this policy as financial turmoil has mounted. They regard their judgment\nconfirmed when they hear commentators proclaim \xe2\x80\x9ccash is king,\xe2\x80\x9d even though that wonderful cash is earning\nclose to nothing and will surely find its purchasing power eroded over time.\n</p>\n<p>Approval, though, is not the goal of investing. In fact, approval is often counter-productive because it\nsedates the brain and makes it less receptive to new facts or a re-examination of conclusions formed earlier.\nBeware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns.\n</p>\n<p>Derivatives\n</p>\n<p>Derivatives are dangerous. They have dramatically increased the leverage and risks in our financial\nsystem. They have made it almost impossible for investors to understand and analyze our largest commercial\nbanks and investment banks. They allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in massive misstatements of\nearnings for years. So indecipherable were Freddie and Fannie that their federal regulator, OFHEO, whose more\nthan 100 employees had no job except the oversight of these two institutions, totally missed their cooking of the\nbooks.\n</p>\n<p>16</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '16': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Indeed, recent events demonstrate that certain big-name CEOs (or former CEOs) at major financial\ninstitutions were simply incapable of managing a business with a huge, complex book of derivatives. Include\nCharlie and me in this hapless group: When Berkshire purchased General Re in 1998, we knew we could not get\nour minds around its book of 23,218 derivatives contracts, made with 884 counterparties (many of which we had\nnever heard of). So we decided to close up shop. Though we were under no pressure and were operating in\nbenign markets as we exited, it took us five years and more than $400 million in losses to largely complete the\ntask. Upon leaving, our feelings about the business mirrored a line in a country song: \xe2\x80\x9cI liked you better before I\ngot to know you so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>Improved \xe2\x80\x9ctransparency\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators for\naverting future train wrecks \xe2\x80\x93 won\xe2\x80\x99t cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanism\nthat would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives.\nAuditors can\xe2\x80\x99t audit these contracts, and regulators can\xe2\x80\x99t regulate them. When I read the pages of \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure\xe2\x80\x9d in\n10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is\ngoing on in their portfolios (and then I reach for some aspirin).\n</p>\n<p>For a case study on regulatory effectiveness, let\xe2\x80\x99s look harder at the Freddie and Fannie example.\nThese giant institutions were created by Congress, which retained control over them, dictating what they could\nand could not do. To aid its oversight, Congress created OFHEO in 1992, admonishing it to make sure the two\nbehemoths were behaving themselves. With that move, Fannie and Freddie became the most intensely-regulated\ncompanies of which I am aware, as measured by manpower assigned to the task.\n</p>\n<p>On June 15, 2003, OFHEO (whose annual reports are available on the Internet) sent its 2002 report to\nCongress \xe2\x80\x93 specifically to its four bosses in the Senate and House, among them none other than Messrs. Sarbanes\nand Oxley. The report\xe2\x80\x99s 127 pages included a self-congratulatory cover-line: \xe2\x80\x9cCelebrating 10 Years of\nExcellence.\xe2\x80\x9d The transmittal letter and report were delivered nine days after the CEO and CFO of Freddie had\nresigned in disgrace and the COO had been fired. No mention of their departures was made in the letter, even\nwhile the report concluded, as it always did, that \xe2\x80\x9cBoth Enterprises were financially sound and well managed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n</p>\n<p>In truth, both enterprises had engaged in massive accounting shenanigans for some time. Finally, in\n2006, OFHEO issued a 340-page scathing chronicle of the sins of Fannie that, more or less, blamed the fiasco on\nevery party but \xe2\x80\x93 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x93 Congress and OFHEO.\n</p>\n<p>The Bear Stearns collapse highlights the counterparty problem embedded in derivatives transactions, a\ntime bomb I first discussed in Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s 2002 report. On April 3, 2008, Tim Geithner, then the able president of\nthe New York Fed, explained the need for a rescue: \xe2\x80\x9cThe sudden discovery by Bear\xe2\x80\x99s derivative counterparties\nthat important financial positions they had put in place to protect themselves from financial risk were no longer\noperative would have triggered substantial further dislocation in markets. This would have precipitated a rush by\nBear\xe2\x80\x99s counterparties to liquidate the collateral they held against those positions and to attempt to replicate those\npositions in already very fragile markets.\xe2\x80\x9d This is Fedspeak for \xe2\x80\x9cWe stepped in to avoid a financial chain reaction\nof unpredictable magnitude.\xe2\x80\x9d In my opinion, the Fed was right to do so.\n</p>\n<p>A normal stock or bond trade is completed in a few days with one party getting its cash, the other its\nsecurities. Counterparty risk therefore quickly disappears, which means credit problems can\xe2\x80\x99t accumulate. This\nrapid settlement process is key to maintaining the integrity of markets. That, in fact, is a reason for NYSE and\nNASDAQ shortening the settlement period from five days to three days in 1995.\n</p>\n<p>Derivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterparties\nbuilding up huge claims against each other. \xe2\x80\x9cPaper\xe2\x80\x9d assets and liabilities \xe2\x80\x93 often hard to quantify \xe2\x80\x93 become\nimportant parts of financial statements though these items will not be validated for many years. Additionally, a\nfrightening web of mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions. Receivables and payables by\nthe billions become concentrated in the hands of a few large dealers who are apt to be highly-leveraged in other\nways as well. Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal\ndisease: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.\n</p>\n<p>17</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '17': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Sleeping around, to continue our metaphor, can actually be useful for large derivatives dealers because\nit assures them government aid if trouble hits. In other words, only companies having problems that can infect\nthe entire neighborhood \xe2\x80\x93 I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention names \xe2\x80\x93 are certain to become a concern of the state (an outcome, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsad to say, that is proper). From this irritating reality comes The First Law of Corporate Survival for ambitious\nCEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: Modest incompetence simply\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do; it\xe2\x80\x99s mindboggling screw-ups that are required.\n</p>\n<p>Considering the ruin I\xe2\x80\x99ve pictured, you may wonder why Berkshire is a party to 251 derivatives\ncontracts (other than those used for operational purposes at MidAmerican and the few left over at Gen Re). The\nanswer is simple: I believe each contract we own was mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so. I both\ninitiated these positions and monitor them, a set of responsibilities consistent with my belief that the CEO of any\nlarge financial organization must be the Chief Risk Officer as well. If we lose money on our derivatives, it will be\nmy fault.\n</p>\n<p>Our derivatives dealings require our counterparties to make payments to us when contracts are\ninitiated. Berkshire therefore always holds the money, which leaves us assuming no meaningful counterparty\nrisk. As of yearend, the payments made to us less losses we have paid \xe2\x80\x93 our derivatives \xe2\x80\x9cfloat,\xe2\x80\x9d so to speak \xe2\x80\x93\ntotaled $8.1 billion. This float is similar to insurance float: If we break even on an underlying transaction, we will\nhave enjoyed the use of free money for a long time. Our expectation, though it is far from a sure thing, is that we\nwill do better than break even and that the substantial investment income we earn on the funds will be frosting on\nthe cake.\n</p>\n<p>Only a small percentage of our contracts call for any posting of collateral when the market moves\nagainst us. Even under the chaotic conditions existing in last year\xe2\x80\x99s fourth quarter, we had to post less than 1% of\nour securities portfolio. (When we post collateral, we deposit it with third parties, meanwhile retaining the\ninvestment earnings on the deposited securities.) In our 2002 annual report, we warned of the lethal threat that\nposting requirements create, real-life illustrations of which we witnessed last year at a variety of financial\ninstitutions (and, for that matter, at Constellation Energy, which was within hours of bankruptcy when\nMidAmerican arrived to effect a rescue).\n</p>\n<p>Our contracts fall into four major categories. With apologies to those who are not fascinated by\nfinancial instruments, I will explain them in excruciating detail.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 We have added modestly to the \xe2\x80\x9cequity put\xe2\x80\x9d portfolio I described in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report. Some of our\ncontracts come due in 15 years, others in 20. We must make a payment to our counterparty at\nmaturity if the reference index to which the put is tied is then below what it was at the inception of\nthe contract. Neither party can elect to settle early; it\xe2\x80\x99s only the price on the final day that counts.\n</p>\n<p>To illustrate, we might sell a $1 billion 15-year put contract on the S&amp;P 500 when that index is at,\nsay, 1300. If the index is at 1170 \xe2\x80\x93 down 10% \xe2\x80\x93 on the day of maturity, we would pay $100 million.\nIf it is above 1300, we owe nothing. For us to lose $1 billion, the index would have to go to zero. In\nthe meantime, the sale of the put would have delivered us a premium \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps $100 million to\n$150 million \xe2\x80\x93 that we would be free to invest as we wish.\n</p>\n<p>Our put contracts total $37.1 billion (at current exchange rates) and are spread among four major\nindices: the S&amp;P 500 in the U.S., the FTSE 100 in the U.K., the Euro Stoxx 50 in Europe, and the\nNikkei 225 in Japan. Our first contract comes due on September 9, 2019 and our last on January 24,\n2028. We have received premiums of $4.9 billion, money we have invested. We, meanwhile, have\npaid nothing, since all expiration dates are far in the future. Nonetheless, we have used Black-\nScholes valuation methods to record a yearend liability of $10 billion, an amount that will change\non every reporting date. The two financial items \xe2\x80\x93 this estimated loss of $10 billion minus the $4.9\nbillion in premiums we have received \xe2\x80\x93 means that we have so far reported a mark-to-market loss\nof $5.1 billion from these contracts.\n</p>\n<p>18</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '18': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>We endorse mark-to-market accounting. I will explain later, however, why I believe the Black-\nScholes formula, even though it is the standard for establishing the dollar liability for options,\nproduces strange results when the long-term variety are being valued.\n</p>\n<p>One point about our contracts that is sometimes not understood: For us to lose the full $37.1 billion\nwe have at risk, all stocks in all four indices would have to go to zero on their various termination\ndates. If, however \xe2\x80\x93 as an example \xe2\x80\x93 all indices fell 25% from their value at the inception of each\ncontract, and foreign-exchange rates remained as they are today, we would owe about $9 billion,\npayable between 2019 and 2028. Between the inception of the contract and those dates, we would\nhave held the $4.9 billion premium and earned investment income on it.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The second category we described in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report concerns derivatives requiring us to pay\nwhen credit losses occur at companies that are included in various high-yield indices. Our standard\ncontract covers a five-year period and involves 100 companies. We modestly expanded our position\nlast year in this category. But, of course, the contracts on the books at the end of 2007 moved one\nyear closer to their maturity. Overall, our contracts now have an average life of 21\xe2\x81\x843 years, with the\nfirst expiration due to occur on September 20, 2009 and the last on December 20, 2013.\n</p>\n<p>By yearend we had received premiums of $3.4 billion on these contracts and paid losses of $542\nmillion. Using mark-to-market principles, we also set up a liability for future losses that at yearend\ntotaled $3.0 billion. Thus we had to that point recorded a loss of about $100 million, derived from\nour $3.5 billion total in paid and estimated future losses minus the $3.4 billion of premiums we\nreceived. In our quarterly reports, however, the amount of gain or loss has swung wildly from a\nprofit of $327 million in the second quarter of 2008 to a loss of $693 million in the fourth quarter of\n2008.\n</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only $97 million last year, far below the\nestimate I used when I decided to enter into them. This year, however, losses have accelerated\nsharply with the mushrooming of large bankruptcies. In last year\xe2\x80\x99s letter, I told you I expected these\ncontracts to show a profit at expiration. Now, with the recession deepening at a rapid rate, the\npossibility of an eventual loss has increased. Whatever the result, I will keep you posted.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 In 2008 we began to write \xe2\x80\x9ccredit default swaps\xe2\x80\x9d on individual companies. This is simply credit\ninsurance, similar to what we write in BHAC, except that here we bear the credit risk of\ncorporations rather than of tax-exempt issuers.\n</p>\n<p>If, say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a $100 million contract, we are\nobligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ\xe2\x80\x99s\ndebt. (If, for example, the company\xe2\x80\x99s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe $70\nmillion.) For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which our\ninsurance expires.\n</p>\n<p>At yearend we had written $4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receive\nannual premiums of $93 million. This is the only derivatives business we write that has any\ncounterparty risk; the party that buys the contract from us must be good for the quarterly premiums\nit will owe us over the five years. We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent because\nmost buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter into\nsuch an arrangement.\n</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 At the request of our customers, we write a few tax-exempt bond insurance contracts that are\nsimilar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives. The only meaningful\ndifference between the two contracts is that mark-to-market accounting is required for derivatives\nwhereas standard accrual accounting is required at BHAC.\n</p>\n<p>19</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '19': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>But this difference can produce some strange results. The bonds covered \xe2\x80\x93 in effect, insured \xe2\x80\x93 by\nthese derivatives are largely general obligations of states, and we feel good about them. At yearend,\nhowever, mark-to-market accounting required us to record a loss of $631 million on these\nderivatives contracts. Had we instead insured the same bonds at the same price in BHAC, and used\nthe accrual accounting required at insurance companies, we would have recorded a small profit for\nthe year. The two methods by which we insure the bonds will eventually produce the same\naccounting result. In the short term, however, the variance in reported profits can be substantial.\n</p>\n<p>We have told you before that our derivative contracts, subject as they are to mark-to-market\naccounting, will produce wild swings in the earnings we report. The ups and downs neither cheer nor bother\nCharlie and me. Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9cdowns\xe2\x80\x9d can be helpful in that they give us an opportunity to expand a position on\nfavorable terms. I hope this explanation of our dealings will lead you to think similarly.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>The Black-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it when\nvaluing our equity put options for financial statement purposes. Key inputs to the calculation include a contract\xe2\x80\x99s\nmaturity and strike price, as well as the analyst\xe2\x80\x99s expectations for volatility, interest rates and dividends.\n</p>\n<p>If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness,\nBlack and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoring\nwhatever caveats the two men attached when they first unveiled the formula.\n</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s often useful in testing a theory to push it to extremes. So let\xe2\x80\x99s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1\nbillion put option on the S&amp;P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index\xe2\x80\x99s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied\nvolatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and\ndividend assumptions, we would find the \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.\n</p>\n<p>To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&amp;P will be valued a century\nfrom now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only\n2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14\xc2\xa2). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher.\nFar more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of\nmost of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about\n175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.\n</p>\n<p>Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year\nperiod to be far less than 1%. But let\xe2\x80\x99s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline \xe2\x80\x93 should one\noccur \xe2\x80\x93 is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5\nmillion ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).\n</p>\n<p>But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to\ninvest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have\nbeen profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?\n</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay\nnothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities \xe2\x80\x93 that\nis, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion \xe2\x80\x93 our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my\nassumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.\n</p>\n<p>20</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '20': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion\nof volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around\nin some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probability-\nweighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote every\nday on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing\nquotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farm\na century from now.)\n</p>\n<p>Though historical volatility is a useful \xe2\x80\x93 but far from foolproof \xe2\x80\x93 concept in valuing short-term options,\nits utility diminishes rapidly as the duration of the option lengthens. In my opinion, the valuations that the Black-\nScholes formula now place on our long-term put options overstate our liability, though the overstatement will\ndiminish as the contracts approach maturity.\n</p>\n<p>Even so, we will continue to use Black-Scholes when we are estimating our financial-statement\nliability for long-term equity puts. The formula represents conventional wisdom and any substitute that I might\noffer would engender extreme skepticism. That would be perfectly understandable: CEOs who have concocted\ntheir own valuations for esoteric financial instruments have seldom erred on the side of conservatism. That club\nof optimists is one that Charlie and I have no desire to join.\n</p>\n<p>The Annual Meeting\n</p>\n<p>Our meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 2nd. As always, the doors will open at the Qwest\nCenter at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the\nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\xe2\x80\x99s stands) will last until 3:00. Then, after\na short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15. If you decide to leave during the day\xe2\x80\x99s\nquestion periods, please do so while Charlie is talking.\n</p>\n<p>The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, the 31,000 people\nwho came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales. But you can do better.\n(A friendly warning: If I find sales are lagging, I lock the exits.)\n</p>\n<p>This year Clayton will showcase its new i-house that includes Shaw flooring, Johns Manville insulation\nand MiTek fasteners. This innovative \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d home, featuring solar panels and numerous other energy-saving\nproducts, is truly a home of the future. Estimated costs for electricity and heating total only about $1 per day\nwhen the home is sited in an area like Omaha. After purchasing the i-house, you should next consider the Forest\nRiver RV and pontoon boat on display nearby. Make your neighbors jealous.\n</p>\n<p>GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 50 jurisdictions in which we\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For\nat least 50% of you, I believe we can.\n</p>\n<p>On Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of NetJets aircraft available for your\ninspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes. Come to Omaha by bus;\nleave in your new plane. And take along \xe2\x80\x93 with no fear of a strip search \xe2\x80\x93 the Ginsu knives that you\xe2\x80\x99ve purchased\nat the exhibit of our Quikut subsidiary.\n</p>\n<p>Next, if you have any money left, visit the Bookworm, which will be selling about 30 books and\nDVDs. A shipping service will be available for those whose thirst for knowledge exceeds their carrying capacity.\n</p>\n<p>21</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '21': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>Finally, we will have three fascinating cars on the exhibition floor, including one from the past and one\nof the future. Paul Andrews, CEO of our subsidiary, TTI, will bring his 1935 Duesenberg, a car that once\nbelonged to Mrs. Forrest Mars, Sr., parent and grandparent of our new partners in the Wrigley purchase. The\nfuture will be represented by a new plug-in electric car developed by BYD, an amazing Chinese company in\nwhich we have a 10% interest.\n</p>\n<p>An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who\nhandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,\nbut work with Carol and you will get one.\n</p>\n<p>At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we\nwill again be having \xe2\x80\x9cBerkshire Weekend\xe2\x80\x9d discount pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM twelve years\nago, and sales during the \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend\xe2\x80\x9d grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to a record $33.3 million in 2008. On\nSaturday of that weekend, we also set a single day record of $7.2 million. Ask any retailer what he thinks of such\nvolume.\n</p>\n<p>To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, April 30th and\nMonday, May 4th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\xe2\x80\x99s special pricing will even\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting\nbut which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their\ncooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.\nOn Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a western cookout to which you are all invited.\n</p>\n<p>At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 1st. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m.\n</p>\n<p>We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27th through Saturday, May 9th. During that period,\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that\nshows you are a Berkshire holder.\n</p>\n<p>On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,\nwill take on all comers \xe2\x80\x93 who will have their eyes wide open \xe2\x80\x93 in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon\nOsberg, two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday\nafternoon.\n</p>\n<p>Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3rd, and will be\nserving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s, which seats 240, served 975 dinners on Shareholder Sunday.\nThe three-day total was 2,448 including 702 T-bone steaks, the entr\xc3\xa9e preferred by the cognoscenti. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t\nembarrass me by ordering foie gras. Remember: To come to Gorat\xe2\x80\x99s on that day, you must have a reservation. To\nmake one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before).\n</p>\n<p>We will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come from\noutside North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and Charlie and I\nwant to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we enjoyed meeting more than 700 of\nyou from many dozens of countries. Any shareholder who comes from outside the U.S. or Canada will be given a\nspecial credential and instructions for attending this function.\n</p>\n<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>22</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>', '22': b'<div class="page"><p></p>\n<p>This year we will be making important changes in how we handle the meeting\xe2\x80\x99s question periods. In\nrecent years, we have received only a handful of questions directly related to Berkshire and its operations. Last\nyear there were practically none. So we need to steer the discussion back to Berkshire\xe2\x80\x99s businesses.\n</p>\n<p>In a related problem, there has been a mad rush when the doors open at 7 a.m., led by people who wish\nto be first in line at the 12 microphones available for questioners. This is not desirable from a safety standpoint,\nnor do we believe that sprinting ability should be the determinant of who gets to pose questions. (At age 78, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nconcluded that speed afoot is a ridiculously overrated talent.) Again, a new procedure is desirable.\n</p>\n<p>In our first change, several financial journalists from organizations representing newspapers,\nmagazines and television will participate in the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that\nshareholders have submitted by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune,\nwho may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com,\nand Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted,\neach journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. (In your\ne-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected.)\n</p>\n<p>Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the\njournalists will pick some tough ones and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we like it.\n</p>\n<p>In our second change, we will have a drawing at 8:15 at each microphone for those shareholders\nhoping to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with\nthose from the winning shareholders. At least half the questions \xe2\x80\x93 those selected by the panel from your\nsubmissions \xe2\x80\x93 are therefore certain to be Berkshire-related. We will meanwhile continue to get some good \xe2\x80\x93 and\nperhaps entertaining \xe2\x80\x93 questions from the audience as well.\n</p>\n<p>So join us at our Woodstock for Capitalists and let us know how you like the new format. Charlie and I\nlook forward to seeing you.\n</p>\n<p>February 27, 2009 Warren E. Buffett\nChairman of the Board\n</p>\n<p>23</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>'}
